newsbtc:b6f818331094b:0,"MicroStrategy Buys Additional 11,930 BTC, Fibonacci Analysis Hints At $160K Bitcoin Price Peak","Thu, 20 Jun 2024 19:00:58 GMT",NewsBTC,"Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, has regained momentum, bouncing off a weekly low of $64,000 to find support above $65,000, halting last week’s downtrend. This price recovery may be due to another significant investment round by business intelligence company MicroStrategy, led by Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor.  

 The company announced on Thursday the acquisition of an additional 11,931 BTC valued at approximately $786.0 million, further solidifying its position as a major institutional holder of the digital asset. 

 MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Holdings Surge To Nearly $15 Billion 

 MicroStrategy’s Chairman and Co-founder, Michael Saylor, revealed the latest acquisition in a social media post. The company purchased 11,931 Bitcoin between April 27 and June 19, utilizing proceeds from convertible notes and excess cash at an average price of $65,883 per Bitcoin.  

 Notably, the recent purchases increased MicroStrategy’s overall Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 226,331 BTC, acquired at a total cost of $8.3 billion, currently valued at approximately $14.9 billion. 

 Saylor’s interest in Bitcoin dates back to 2020, when he began purchasing the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation and an alternative to holding cash. Since then, Bitcoin has experienced substantial growth, appreciating around 600% since Saylor’s initial investments.  

 The recent purchase by MicroStrategy comes at a time when market sentiment towards Bitcoin is mixed. Market intelligence platform Santiment reports that the community is “mainly fearful” or disinterested as Bitcoin’s price hovers between $64,000 and $65,000.  

 However, Santiment suggests that BTC trader fatigue, combined with whale accumulation exemplified by MicroStrategy’s latest acquisition, often leads to price bounces “that reward the patient,” as seen in the image above.  

 BTC’s Cycle Top To Reach New Heights 

 Despite the current mixed sentiment in the market, most experts and analysts are forecasting a cycle top for Bitcoin beyond the current all-time highs. Market analyst Crypto Con recently used Fibonacci retracements to forecast conservative and less conservative potential cycle top targets. 

 According to Crypto Con’s analysis, the .618 Fibonacci retracement level has proven reliable for previous Bitcoin cycle tops. Extension levels can be derived by retracing from the cycle bottom to the top of the first move. The cycle tops of 2013 and 2017 were predicted at 4.618, while the 2021 top was forecasted at the 5.618 level.  

 For the current cycle, the conservative target for the cycle top is $106,000, while the less conservative target stands at $161,000, according to Crypto Con. 

 Adding to the positive sentiment, wealth management firm Bernstein has made bold predictions for Bitcoin’s future price trajectory. Despite arguments from bears that the Bitcoin ETF trade is over and early allocations were driven by retail investors, Bernstein holds a different viewpoint.  

 The firm emphasizes that Bitcoin ETFs are on the verge of approvals at major wirehouses and large private bank platforms in this year’s third or fourth quarter. These potential approvals and institutional interest act as a catalyst for adoption. 

 Bernstein expects Bitcoin to reach a cycle high of approximately $200,000 by 2025, $500,000 by 2029, and an impressive $1 million by 2033. The firm asserts that institutional investors are evaluating “net long” positions, indicating a growing interest in the cryptocurrency. 

 At the time of writing, BTC has limited its losses in the 7-day time frame to 3.6%, resulting in a current trading price of $65,170 for the largest cryptocurrency on the market.

cointelegraph:c43b74741094b:0,Italian gov’t to ramp up surveillance of crypto market,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 18:00:00 GMT",Cointelegraph,"Italy is set to ramp up surveillance of the crypto markets as part of its compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. 

 Under the new regulations, Italy will increase oversight over the digital asset markets to curb and punish insider trading and market manipulation schemes. 

 The decree stipulates fines ranging between 5,000 and 5 million euros ($5,400–$5.4 million) depending on the severity and scope of the regulatory violations. 

 The MiCA regulatory framework’s effects 

 First passed in 2022, the European Union’s MiCA regulatory framework is forcing blockchain firms to make some tough calls, while decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are left with the difficult choice of fully decentralizing their networks or submitting to the framework’s Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer regulations.Cointelegraph 

 Fully decentralized networks are exempt from MiCA’s reporting requirements. However, due to the use of foundations and other intermediaries that help moderate decentralized communities, these protocols risk breaching MiCA’s definition of a sufficiently decentralized network. 

 This means these DeFi protocols must either fully decentralize or accept a situation where users must submit verification data — a tough sell for many network participants.

cointelegraph:7607938ac094b:0, Bitcoin’s days below $70K are numbered as traders cite BTC’s swing low as the bottom ,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 17:52:52 GMT",Cointelegraph,"Bitcoin’s BTCUSD price has been trending lower over the last two weeks, and analysts believe that the pioneer cryptocurrency appears to have “bottomed” in the area between $63,000 and $65,000.  

 “Bitcoin has likely bottomed in this area between $63-65K,” MN Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe wrote in a June 20 post on the X social media network.  

 Van de Poppe’s analysis appears to have been informed by Bitcoin’s modest bounce from $64,950 to a high of $66,455 during the European trading session on June 20.  

 The analyst shared the following chart with his X followers. It shows BTC bouncing off a key demand level, indicated by the green band, stretching from $63,000 to $65,000. 

 Van de Poppe explained that if the price holds above this level, it will find “itself in upward momentum.” 

 Cointelegraph 

 Fellow analyst Jelle shared a similar sentiment, declaring that BTC continued the fight for range lows around the key $65,000 support level and that bulls were working on turning the market structure around to lock in “a local higher low and higher high.” 

 “Bitcoin’s local market structure is slowly shifting back to bullish. Eyes on a reclaim of $66,000 - for confirmation of strength,” Jelle explained. 

 The 200-day EMA provides the last line of defense for Bitcoin’s price 

 Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows Bitcoin’s price action has formed a series of higher lows on the daily chart to stay above the ascending trendline. Bitcoin bulls are required to hold the price above this level to secure the recovery.  

 The appearance of a doji candlestick on the daily chart implied the importance of the $65,000 level for both buyers and sellers.Cointelegraph 

 However, if bulls lose the ongoing battle, they may retreat toward the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), which appears to be the last line of defense for BTC at $64,300.  

 Data from IntoTheBlock, whose In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) model reveals that Bitcoin’s price sits on relatively strong support downward, also reinforces this level’s importance.  

 The 200-day EMA and the $65,000 psychological level are found within the $64,018–$65,975 price range, where approximately 1.07 million BTC was previously bought by about 1.75 million addresses. Cointelegraph 

 This suggests that high demand-side liquidity from this cohort of investors could push BTC’s price past the resistance provided by the 100- and 50-day EMAs at $66,699 and $67,000, respectively, breaking it out of consolidation and into price discovery. 

 If this happens, according to popular analyst Moustache, BTC’s price below $70,000 could be the last time we see it.  

 Moustache explained that the BTC price was nurturing an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily timeframe, which is becoming “more and more of a reality” for Bitcoin.Cointelegraph 

 The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern forms a reversal setup and includes an “inverted” head and shoulders, with the left and right shoulders upside down below the neckline.  

 If the pattern continues, Bitcoin’s price could embark on a massive upward breakout toward its next key price level of $72,000 before potentially breaking its current all-time high price of $73,835, eventually making a run for $100,000, according to Jelle. 

 This would be an almost 55% jump from the current price, according to CoinMarketCap data.

u_today:8d90e7ce0094b:0,Key Reason Why Bitcoin (BTC) Is Crashing Despite Surging Stocks,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 17:40:34 GMT",U.Today,"The price of Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is losing ground despite the strength of the US stock market.  

 The flagship cryptocurrency slipped to an intraday low of $64,544 after reaching a peak of $66,436, according to CoinGecko data.  

 The recent bearishness could be related to the Bitcoin selling spree initiated by the German government. According to data provided by analytics platform Arkham Intelligence, the German government sent $65 million to two likely exchange deposits including Coinbase. Notably, Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, has noticed that selling pressure is primary origination from the Coinbase exchange.  

 This comes after the German government sent $130 million worth of Bitcoin to various exchanges that included Kraken and Bitstamp. It continues to hold a whopping $3.05 billion worth of Bitcoin.  

 German authorities famously seized a whopping 50,000 Bitcoins from Movie2k.to, the now-defunct piracy website, back in 2013.  

 Nvidia keeps surging  

 In the meantime, the benchmark S&P 500 index briefly surpassed 5,500 for the first time ever earlier today before paring some gains.  

 The US stock market is being propped up by the remarkable surge of tech giant Nvidia. After becoming the most valuable public company in the world, Nvidia's market capitalization now stands at a staggering $3.4 trillion. This makes it bigger than France's GDP and the entire crypto industry.  

 The majority of traders believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve is going to cut rates before November. This could give the battered cryptocurrency market some hope since a looser monetary policy would benefit crypto.

beincrypto:163cf4476094b:0,Trading Firm Jump Crypto Under Investigation by the CFTC,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 17:37:20 GMT",Beincrypto,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has initiated an investigation into Jump Crypto. 

 This probe examines the firm’s trading and investment activities in the cryptocurrency market. It is important to note that this investigation does not imply any wrongdoing by Jump. 

 Jump Crypto Under Investigation 

 Jump has faced significant challenges over the past three years. Known for its algorithmic trading, the firm emerged as a key player in the crypto market, providing market-making services and investing in various crypto projects. However, a series of high-profile incidents have marred its reputation. 

 In September 2021, Jump officially launched Jump Crypto, appointing Kanav Kariya, a former intern, as president. It quickly became one of the top market makers, offering liquidity for new tokens and investing heavily in the sector. The firm also developed notable projects like Wormhole, Pyth, and Firedancer through its incubation and engineering arm. 

 However, Jump’s operations soon encountered significant issues. In 2022, the Wormhole platform suffered a $325 million hack. Jump stepped in to cover the loss, showcasing its substantial financial resources. Later that year, Jump was affected by the collapse of the FTX exchange, where it had served as a major market maker, resulting in nearly $300 million in losses. 

 Further controversy arose in February 2023 when the SEC filed a lawsuit against Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon, alleging fraud related to the TerraUSD stablecoin. Jump was identified as the firm that secretly helped maintain TerraUSD’s peg during a 2021 crisis, although it faced no charges. 

 In March 2023, the Justice Department filed criminal charges against Kwon, again mentioning Jump’s role in maintaining TerraUSD’s peg. Despite these mentions, no allegations of wrongdoing were made against Jump. 

 The CFTC’s current investigation into Jump’s crypto activities represents the latest regulatory scrutiny the firm faces. While it remains uncertain if any charges will be brought, this probe highlights the growing regulatory focus on the cryptocurrency market.

the_block:7497d8d0f094b:0,Anime-themed Azuki eyes ‘post-NFT world’ with hire of former Hollywood exec,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 17:36:25 GMT",The Block,"Top-tier NFT brand Azuki announced on Thursday that it has hired veteran entertainment executive Steve Chung as Chief Operating Officer as the company seeks to expand beyond digital collectibles. 

 Chung, whose experience includes working in Hollywood and Silicon Valley, will be tasked with helping Azuki grow its fanbase and revenue opportunities.  

 ""In some ways, we're in a post-NFT world,"" Chung told The Block. ""[But] we have 50,000 amazing characters that are owned by individuals who are super passionate about that community … and there is a very clear path toward using that as the next leverage, telling the story."" 

 In a bid to build upon the popularity created largely during the bull run of 2021, popular NFT brands like Bored Apes, Pudgy Penguins, Azuki, and others are increasingly pivoting towards traditional business strategies such as content creation, gaming and merchandising. The need to transform and transition comes as royalties for NFT creators have withered dramatically.  

 Chung pointed to Azuki releasing an animated series based on the collection’s IP and how that could help the brand tap into the larger, wildly-popular world of anime. The first episode, produced with the help of traditional Japanese anime creators, according to Chung, is already out. The YouTube clip of the first episode has more than 1 million after about a month. 

 The one time Fox executive said Azuki’s anime theme is what sets it apart from rival NFT brands. ""Where we can differentiate with Azuki is we're not a generic object or animal. Not to disparage anybody, but we have a theme. It's the anime culture that's our differentiation,"" he said.

 In March, Azuki also announced it had teamed up with Arbitrum Foundation in another initiative geared towards creating a web3 network which targets anime fans. Azuki is created by Los Angeles-based Chiru Labs. 

 Previous to joining Azuki, Chung served as Chief Global Officer for Korean entertainment juggernaut CJ ENM Entertainment after working for Fox Corporation. The Stanford and Harvard grad started his career at Goldman Sachs, according to his LinkedIn profile.

newsbtc:06f95f252094b:0,Cardano And XRP Shorting Activity Could Act As ‘Rocket Fuel’ For A Rally; Santiment,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 17:30:50 GMT",NewsBTC,"On-chain analytics platform Santiment has outlined a factor that could contribute to Cardano (ADA) and XRP enjoying further moves to the upside. Both tokens recorded relief pumps following the recent decline in the crypto market, but market traders believe this development is far from a bullish reversal.  

 Heavy Trader Shorting Could Lead To Price Rises For Cardano And XRP 

 Santiment claimed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the heavy trader shorting which Cardano and XRP are currently seeing could be the “rocket fuel” for continued price rises for these crypto tokens. Santiment had also revealed that Cardano and XRP were among the most notable altcoins that are heavily shorted following their relief bounces.  

 Interestingly, they called this a “good sign” for the patient bulls, as they believe that liquidation of these short positions could effectively be the momentum that these crypto tokens need to rise higher. Cardano and XRP being named among the most shorted altcoins isn’t surprising, considering that they are the most underperforming coins this year among the top 50 crypto tokens by market cap.  

 Cardano and XRP have also usually failed to enjoy significant relief pumps even when Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market enjoy a massive rebound. However, this time could be different, as Cardano and XRP have enjoyed a modest price recovery while some other altcoins lag.  

 Data from Coinglass shows that Santiment’s theory could already be in play, seeing how the Cardano and XRP bears have suffered significant losses in the last 24 hours. Over $50,000 in Cardano short positions have been liquidated during this period, while not a single cent in Cardano long positions have been liquidated. Similarly, over $30,000 in XRP short positions have been liquidated while XRP longs were unaffected.  

 A Major Move Might Be On The Horizon For XRP 

 Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto recently predicted that XRP could enjoy a price pump of around 1,700% starting in July. He alluded to XRP’s quarterly hammer formation between April and June 2016 and July and September 2017 before the crypto token enjoyed a major pump. The crypto analyst stated that XRP could form this bullish pattern again but needed to close the 3-month candle above the range between $0.55 and $0.58 in 10 days.  

 Egrag further claimed that if the hammer formation is similar to the one in 2016, the XRP could begin the projected 1,700% price rally in July, eventually sending the crypto token to $8. However, if the hammer formation is similar to the one in 2017, Egrag mentioned that XRP holders might have to wait another six months before the “epic” pump of around 5,500%, sending XRP’s price to $27.

cointelegraph:b942f2494094b:0,macOS of blockchains? Solana captures 60% of new DEX volume in May,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 17:30:00 GMT",Cointelegraph,"Over 60% of the incremental volume in decentralized exchanges in May was recorded on the Solana blockchain, according to data compiled by venture capital firm Pantera Capital. 

 Behind this growth is a monolithic architecture, said Pantera in a June 18 report, calling the network the macOS of blockchains.  

 Solana’s share of DEX volume has risen from 0% in early 2021 to 24% by May 2024, thanks to an approach similar to Apple’s macOS architecture that integrates hardware and software for superior performance. According to Pantera, Solana’s architecture has enabled a surge in retail activity over the past few months:  

 Pantera is one of the investors in the Solana blockchain. Earlier this year, the venture capital firm raised money for a new fund aimed at purchasing up to $250 million worth of Solana’s SOLUSD tokens from FTX bankruptcy state at a steep discount. 

 The network’s unique active addresses rose from 14,000 in October 2020 to nearly 1.3 million by May 2024. As a result, priority fees on Solana have exploded, growing from less than $100,000 per month in mid-2023 to more than $60 million in March 2024, notes the report. Cointelegraph 

 Solana’s architecture has also made it a popular choice for developers behind memecoins and decentralized infrastructure (DePin) projects. Since January, the network has seen a growing volume of new tokens, outpacing other chains such as BNB, Ethereum, and Polygon. The report notes: 

 Solana’s performance is also affecting its SOL token. According to CoinMarketCap, the price of SOL has risen over 723% in the past year, trading at $123 at the time of writing.  

 Are network outages a thing of the past? 

 Pantera’s report does not address the network’s challenges over the past years, such as Solana’s downtime amid technical challenges. The last outage, on Feb. 9, resulted in nearly five hours of downtime. 

 Solana’s Firedancer upgrade, slated for a full version in 2025 with “pared-down versions” rolling out before then, is expected to boost the network’s resilience. The upgrade, an independent validator client under development with Jump Crypto, is intended to increase Solana’s overall reliability and scalability as activity increases.

 FIO Info 

 FIO Protocol is an innovative blockchain platform designed to streamline the often complex and intimidating process of transacting with cryptocurrencies. The protocol aims to eradicate common issues associated with cryptocurrency transactions, namely the necessity of using convoluted addresses, which can result in costly errors and misplaced funds. 

 Traditionally, cryptocurrency transactions have required long, alphanumeric addresses that are prone to misinterpretation. FIO Protocol counters this challenge by implementing a universal, human-friendly address format that spans across multiple blockchain platforms. In practical terms, this means that an intricate sequence of numbers and letters could be replaced by a simplified address format, such as 'user@wallet'. 

 Additionally, the FIO Protocol enhances usability by introducing features that are commonplace in conventional digital payment systems, like payment requests and transaction metadata. This bridges the gap between the traditional finance industry and the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. 

 Crucially, the FIO Protocol does not intrude upon the operations of other blockchains. It functions as a complementary usability layer capable of interacting with any blockchain or token without requiring direct integration. Thus, the FIO Protocol represents a significant step forward in making cryptocurrencies more accessible and user-friendly, and signals an evolution in the wider adoption of blockchain technology.

 FIL Info 

 Filecoin FILUSD is a decentralized storage system that aims to ""store humanity's most important information"". The project raised significant funds via an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017. Filecoin is the digital token that is used as payment for storage or retrieval of data within the network. The network uses a unique proof-of-storage system where miners earn more by sharing more storage, and the data they store is constantly verified to ensure its correctness. Filecoin competes with centralized storage systems such as Amazon S3, and allows individuals to monetize their spare storage space on the network.

cointelegraph:cba79c8f9094b:0,Hashing It Out: Layer-2 challenges and enterprise adoption with LightLink CEO,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 17:10:01 GMT",Cointelegraph,"In this episode of Cointelegraph’s Hashing it Out podcast, host Elisha Owusu Akyaw interviews Roy Hui, co-founder and CEO of LightLink, a layer-2 blockchain. Hui discusses the current state of the blockchain industry, the challenges faced by layer-2 solutions, and LightLink’s unique approach to addressing these challenges.  

 Hui discusses the current landscape of blockchain technology, noting the saturation of layer-1 and layer-2 networks while emphasizing the vast untapped potential for real-world applications. 

 He also admits that the space is getting crowded because fewer people use onchain applications for everyday activities. Due to this saturation, various networks need to find ways to differentiate themselves from their counterparts. 

 Hui emphasizes LightLink’s focus on enterprise adoption and its mission to accelerate the global adoption of Web3 technologies.  

 He explains how LightLink’s gasless transactions were designed to attract Web2 users and enterprises. Hui highlights the challenges enterprises face in adopting Web3, including the technology’s complexity, risk and the fluctuating cost of transactions. According to him, removing the cost of transactions and the need to estimate what that cost could be is an important step in creating a user experience similar to Web2 platforms.  

 The conversation also touches on the importance of community building and developer engagement in the Web3 space. Hui shares LightLink’s strategies for attracting developers and users, such as hackathons and airdrops. Hui admits that doing airdrops has become more difficult in 2024 as more users come online and expectations increase. He adds that with so much going on in the space, airdrops may not be enough to retain users on a particular network.

coindesk:7e390a802094b:0,"Mexican Cartels Using BTC, ETH, USDT, Other Tokens to Buy Fentanyl Ingredients: U.S.","Thu, 20 Jun 2024 17:08:48 GMT",CoinDesk,"Criminal organizations in Mexico have been using several popular digital assets to buy the raw materials needed to make the drug fentanyl, according to the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which cited the use of bitcoin and other tokens in a Thursday advisory. 

 The cartels ""are increasingly purchasing fentanyl precursor chemicals and manufacturing equipment"" from China-based suppliers and paying in tokens including bitcoin {{BTC}}, ether {{ETH}}, monero {{XMR}}, and tether {{USDT}} ""among others,"" according to an updated FinCEN advisory to alert U.S. financial firms about the network of criminal organizations producing the dangerous narcotic. 

 The payments often end up in the Chinese suppliers' hosted wallets at crypto firms, sometimes through a secondary money transmitter, according to the notice. 

 The new warnings, updating a FinCEN advisory from 2019, reflect problems that had already emerged in sanctions and criminal cases brought by U.S. authorities. 

 In October, the U.S. Department of Justice charged eight China-tied companies with illegal drug production, distribution and sales of precursor chemicals. 

 U.S. overdoses involving fentanyl have become the leading killer for those aged 18-45. The chemicals used to manufacture the dangerous drug often come from China and wind their way across multiple borders on their path to U.S. users of the synthetic opioid, which the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) says is 100 times more potent than morphine.

cointelegraph:2a119ef48094b:0,Failed House candidate and partner of ex-FTX exec starts crypto think tank,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 16:50:00 GMT",Cointelegraph,"With her partner set to report to prison in 70 days after his sentencing related to FTX’s downfall, Michelle Bond announced the launch of a crypto-focused think tank in Washington, DC. 

 In a June 20 notice, Bond said she had helped launch the think tank Digital Future. According to her LinkedIn, the think tank is one of the first professional experiences Bond listed since the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Contributions to her 2022 campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives connected to the firm became part of the charges against her partner Ryan Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets. 

 According to Bond, the think tank would focus on helping create a “favorable regulatory environment” for financial technology, digital assets and artificial intelligence (AI) in the United States. She added that U.S. lawmakers “have yet to pass significant and impactful legislation on crypto and AI.”  

 Before the collapse of FTX, Bond served as the CEO of the Association for Digital Asset Markets. She has also been the CEO of Capitol Advisory since 2023 — a “consulting firm that assists fintech firms with regulatory, legal and public policy issues and advice” — and served as counsel for the U.S. Senate Banking Committee from 2011 to 2012. 

 The timing of the crypto think tank’s launch was unclear. Less than five months remain until the U.S. presidential election, and many states hold primaries in June. Cointelegraph reached out to Digital Future for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication. 

 In September 2023, Salame pleaded guilty to conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions and operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. In May, a federal judge sentenced the former FTX executive to 7.5 years in prison. He is scheduled to report to authorities on Aug. 29. 

 Salame’s charges were directly related to Bond’s congressional campaign. She ran as a Republican to represent New York’s 1st Congressional District in 2022, but the campaign did not move beyond the party’s primary. The former FTX executive allegedly contributed to Bond’s campaign on behalf of a corporation, violating U.S. law. 

 Since his sentencing hearing, Salame resumed activity on his X account for the first time in roughly two years, commenting on the crypto market and the U.S. political landscape ahead of reporting to prison. He has a seven-month-old child with Bond.

 The derivatives regulator is specifically looking into the firm's crypto involvement, such as trading and investing, Fortune reported on Thursday. 

 The CFTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Block. Jump declined to comment when contacted by The Block. 

 Both the CFTC and its sister agency, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, have honed in on bringing charges against crypto-related entities over the past few years. Over the past year or so, the CFTC and SEC have brought several enforcement actions against crypto entities, including Binance and FTX. 

 In a case involving the SEC and Terraform Labs, the agency named an unidentified ""U.S. trading firm,"" accused of helping support the TerraUSD stablecoin as it de-pegged from the dollar in 2021, which later was found out to be Jump Trading. The SEC did not bring charges against Jump.

the_block:f06befda4094b:0,One analyst remains bullish on DeFi Technologies’s stock following negative CoinSnacks newsletter,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 16:12:22 GMT",The Block,"Shares of DeFi Technologies (DEFTF) plunged this week after a popular crypto newsletter issued a negative report about the company. Though the stock gained 3,400% in the 12 months immediately before the selloff, one analyst remains bullish on it despite the price drop on Tuesday. It dropped as much as 44% from its Monday highs on the over-the-counter market, though it is still up 85% month-to-date.  

 “While DEFI’s shares may have been due for a healthy pullback after their exceptionally strong recent rally, we view the extent of the sell-off as overdone, and we regard the stock’s significant repricing as an attractive buying opportunity,” wrote investment bank Benchmark's senior research analyst Mark Palmer. He reiterated a “buy” rating on and CA$3.00 price target. 

 DeFi Technologies has two primary business lines. One is DeFi Ventures, which focuses on pre-seed to Series A backing of founders, projects and networks across decentralized finance and web3. The other is Valour Asset Management, which gives investors to gain exposure to digital assets and defi. Valour is an issuer of exchange-traded products (ETPs) tracking the performance of digital assets with listings on several European stock exchanges, including Euronext, Frankfurt Stock Exchange and Nordic Growth Market. 

 On Tuesday, CoinSnacks called into question the basis for DeFi’s massive stock run over the past year. 

 ""The problem for DeFi Technologies really is that their promotional IR blitz has worked out so well,"" the newsletter said. ""Between the influencer pumps, getting mentioned on CNBC, the email campaigns, and Pomp pomping, there is now strong evidence that the stock isn’t rallying for the right reasons."" 

 ""Pomp"" refers to Anthony Pompliano, who has been an advisor to DeFi Technologies since 2021. In January 2024, Pompliano’s research firm, Reflexivity Research, was acquired in an all-stock deal by DeFi. 

 DeFi’s stock lost almost half its value following the newsletter’s publication and Benchmark noted that most of DeFi's ETPs are focused on altcoins, which have also sold off recently. 

 For its part, DeFi issued a release Wednesday and described the CoinSacks thesis as a ""misleading short and distort"" report, saying it ""lacks merit and contains numerous defamatory, selective, inaccurate, incomplete and misleading statements, speculation, and innuendo."" 

 The Toronto-based DeFi publicly trades on Canada’s CBOE and in the U.S. on the OTC markets. At publication time, its Canadian-listed shares traded at around $2.05, down 10% on the day, according to Yahoo Finance. Its OTC shares traded down a similar percentage to $1.48.

beincrypto:b185fbcf7094b:0,Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Recovery Sits in the Hands of Investors,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 16:05:58 GMT",Beincrypto,"Bitcoin Cash’s (BCH) price could note recovery over the next couple of trading sessions if the investors support it. 

 The cues seem to suggest recovery for BCH, given that accumulation and HODLing are prevalent. 

 Bitcoin Cash Investors Are Optimistic 

 Bitcoin Cash’s price could be viewed as a recovery based on investors’ behavior as well as broader market cues. The first hint comes from the participation of the investors. Upon distributing the active addresses by profitability, it can be noted that investors in profit are not very active right now. 

 Their participation only dominates 6% of the active addresses. This is a good sign as it means that the investors are not looking to sell their holdings at the moment. Given that more than 75% of BCH holders are currently in profit, it is a big deal that very few are looking to book profits. 

 This could aid the price should the investors move to accumulate, as signaled in the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio.  

 The MVRV ratio assesses investor profit and loss. Currently, Bitcoin Cash’s 30-day MVRV stands at -16%, indicating losses, which may lead to buying pressure. Historically, BCH MVRV between -9% and -25% usually signals the start of recovery rallies, marking an opportunity zone for accumulation. 

 Thus, if BCH holders move to add more tokens to their wallets, the Bitcoin namesake could recover. 

 BCH Price Prediction: Looking at Recovery 

 Bitcoin Cash’s price is currently at $392 and could close above $400 over the coming days. However, in order to secure a recovery rally, the altcoin would need to close above $420 or $430. 

 This is possible should the investors continue to HODL and accumulate at the same time. The target price stands at $440 for BCH however, this could take some time. 

 However, if securing $400 as a support floor fails, Bitcoin Cash’s price could end up falling back to $379. Losing this support would invalidate the bullish thesis, sending BCH to $360.

 Dogecoin DOGEUSD ""very bullish,"" recent report says 

 In a recent X post, Santiment on-chain data company shared a report on the recent 30-day MVRV (Market Capitalization by the Realized Capitalization) of six of the top 10 cryptocurrencies, including popular dog-themed meme coins, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. As explained in the report, the lower the MVRV of a cryptocurrency, the higher the chance it has of enjoying a short-term price bounce in the future. The lowest MVRV was spotted for Dogecoin, -16.7%, which basically means ""very bullish;"" the second crypto after DOGE in terms of ""bullishness"" is ADA, with -12.6%. The readings for the remaining cryptocurrencies on this list — Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and Toncoin — are ""neutral"" and ""mildly bullish."" 

 XRP vs. Ethereum: SEC decision ignites XRP community's fury 

 According to a recent announcement by Consensys, the SEC has wrapped up its investigation into Ethereum. Even though this development is a major win for both the second-largest digital asset and the entire crypto industry, the XRP community is not celebrating it as vividly as the others. The reason for this lies in the long-standing ""feud"" between XRP and ETH, stemming from so-called ""ETHGate,"" or the alleged preferential treatment that Ethereum received from the SEC at the expense of XRP and other cryptos. XRP enthusiast and attorney Bill Morgan voiced his disapproval of the SEC's prioritization of ETH in a recent X post, noting that this is Ethereum's second ""free pass"" from the regulator. ""Ethereum’s and Ripple’s different treatment will forever show how arbitrary the SEC has been in crypto,"" Morgan stated. 

 Schiff names surprising reason why Nvidia’s rise is bearish for Bitcoin 

 On Tuesday, June 18, Nvidia, an American tech company known for its advanced GPU microchips, was reported to become the world’s biggest public company by market capitalization, surpassing Microsoft. Following the achievement, Peter Schiff, prominent Bitcoin critic, used this breaking news as another opportunity to pour cold water on the flagship crypto. Schiff took to his X handle to argue that Nvidia's surge is in fact bearish for Bitcoin, pointing out the largest crypto's lack of utility. As proof, he wrote that Nvidia's GPUs contain ""from .1 to .3 grams of gold,"" but ""zero sats."" Moreover, Schiff said that Bitcoin actually needs gold due to GPU mining: ""Bitcoin needs gold. Gold does not need Bitcoin. Nothing needs Bitcoin,"" he said.

financemagnates:6db747067094b:0,Bitflyer Takes the Reins: Acquiring FTX Japan amid Bankruptcy Fallout,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 16:01:51 GMT",Finance Magnates,"Today (Thursday), it was disclosed that Bitflyer, a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange, has acquired the Japanese operations of FTX, which had previously filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2022. FTX Japan was among over 100 affiliated entities included in the bankruptcy proceedings. 

 Asset Segregation Raises Recovery Hopes 

 In contrast to its parent company, FTX Japan reported having more assets than liabilities, with approximately $134 million in user assets segregated from FTX Trading. This distinction raised hopes for the potential recovery of funds belonging to Japanese customers. 

 Bitcoin.com News reported over a year and five months ago that FTX Japan customers would gradually be allowed to withdraw their assets. Founded by Yuzo Kano, a former Goldman Sachs trader, Bitflyer is a well-established cryptocurrency exchange in Japan, having received a license from the Japanese Financial Services Agency in September 2017. 

 Just-In: BitFlyer Exchange Plans To Acquire FTX Japan https://t.co/W00Wq9XkmB 

 According to NHK, Bitflyer is set to acquire all shares of FTX Japan, valuing the subsidiary in the range of several billion yen. As of the latest update, Bitflyer has reported a 24-hour trade volume of approximately $73.11 million, prominently driven by BTC/JPY transactions. It currently ranks 22nd among global exchanges by trading volume as of Today. 

 Implementing TRUST Network 

 In preparation for Japan's stricter cryptocurrency regulations starting in June 2023, Bitflyer implemented enhanced anti-money laundering rules aligning with the FATF's Travel Rule, as reported by Finance Magnates.  

 These rules mandate sharing customer details for transactions exceeding $3,000, including sender and recipient names, addresses, and account information. Bitflyer now restricts deposits and transfers unless counterparties are part of the Travel Rule Universal Solution Technology (TRUST) network.  

 This network, backed by major exchanges like Coinbase and BitGo, facilitates secure information transmission among virtual asset service providers to comply with regulatory requirements effectively.

cointelegraph:96f0c1cc2094b:0, Bernstein analysts expect $200K Bitcoin price by 2025 due to spot BTC ETF flows ,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 16:01:20 GMT",Cointelegraph,"Analysts at research and brokerage firm Bernstein predict that Bitcoin BTCUSD could reach nearly $200,000 by the end of next year, following strong inflows into spot U.S. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since their approval in January. This prediction is an upward revision from their previous target of $150,000. 

 The analysts based this prediction on the assumption that spot Bitcoin ETFs may represent around 7% of the total circulating Bitcoin supply by the end of 2025. 

 “We see Bitcoin ETFs as on the cusp of approvals at major wirehouses/large private bank platforms in Q3/Q4,” Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote in a note to clients. 

 The analysts said that currently, nearly 80% of the spot Bitcoin ETF flows come from self-directed retail investors through broker platforms, while institutional integrations with wirehouses are still in their infancy. 

 “Around $15 billion of net new flows have been brought in by the ETFs combined,” the analyst wrote. “We expect Bitcoin ETFs to be equivalent to ~7% of Bitcoin in circulation by 2025 and ~15% of Bitcoin supply by 2033.” 

 Cointelegraph 

 Bernstein analysts also suggest that BTC price has entered a new bull market cycle driven by the recent Bitcoin halving event. They expect new catalysts to emerge that will drive demand for the asset. 

 Apart from capital flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, the pioneer cryptocurrency has seen significant institutional funds pouring in.  

 MicroStrategy, the largest corporate BTC holder, continues its aggressive BTC accumulation strategy, acquiring an additional 11,931 BTC for approximately $786.0 million, according to founder and former CEO Michael Saylor. Cointelegraph 

 The business intelligence firm now holds 226,331 BTC, approximately 1.15% of Bitcoin’s total global supply.  

 MicroStrategy earlier announced its plans to offer $800 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2032, the proceeds of which will boost its Bitcoin holdings.  

 If it continues to accumulate Bitcoin over the next few years, Bernstein predicts that the company’s holdings could grow to represent 1.5% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply by the end of 2025.

newsbtc:83ca3453a094b:0,87% Of Bitcoin Hodlers Laughing All The Way To The Bank – Here’s Why,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 16:00:56 GMT",NewsBTC,"The current state of the Bitcoin market offers a mix of optimism and caution for investors. Over 87% of Bitcoin holders are in profit, with their investments valued higher than their initial purchase prices. 

 On average, these investors are seeing unrealized gains of 120%, a significant figure that reflects the substantial rally that pushed Bitcoin to its all-time high in March, according to Glassnode data. However, despite these gains, the market exhibits both encouraging long-term trends and some short-term uncertainties that merit closer examination. 

 Profitability And Market Metrics 

 The profitability among Bitcoin investors is notable. The MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) metric, a key indicator of market sentiment, remains comfortably above its yearly baseline. This metric measures the ratio of Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value and serves as a gauge of average unrealized profit across the market. 

 A high MVRV ratio indicates that most investors are sitting on substantial unrealized gains, painting a positive picture of the market’s health. This upward trend contrasts with the recent price volatility, underscoring the resilience of long-term investors who bought the dip and are now seeing their foresight rewarded. 

 Reduced Trading Activity And Demand 

 Despite the overall profitability, the Bitcoin market is experiencing a notable reduction in trading activity. The vibrant speculative trading that once characterized the market has significantly diminished. 

 Day traders, who previously capitalized on price swings, have retreated, resulting in reduced trading volumes and tepid demand. This lack of speculative trading has led to a stagnation in Bitcoin prices, which are now confined to a well-defined range. The market’s current state can be likened to a calm period after a storm, where activity is subdued, and prices sway gently without significant movement.Investor Caution And Market Sentiment 

 The reduced trading activity reflects a broader sentiment of caution among investors. The current period of consolidation suggests that many investors are taking a wait-and-see approach, carefully assessing the market landscape before making any decisive moves. 

 This cautious sentiment is further evidenced by on-chain data showing a significant decrease in the flow of Bitcoin into exchanges. Typically, an increase in Bitcoin transfers to exchanges is a precursor to selling activity, as holders look to liquidate their positions. The current decline in these transfers indicates that both short-term and long-term holders are refraining from selling, preferring to hold onto their assets. 

 Short-term holders, who once actively traded Bitcoin for quick profits, are now transferring significantly fewer coins compared to the peak levels seen in March. This behavior suggests a shift towards a more conservative strategy, possibly in anticipation of future price movements. Long-term investors, on the other hand, appear content to maintain their positions, exhibiting confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential despite the short-term market stagnation.

the_block:2d96ec28a094b:0,Midas launches new yield-bearing token mBASIS to compete with Ethena,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 16:00:02 GMT",The Block,"Midas, a tokenization platform backed by Coinbase Ventures and others, has launched a new yield-bearing token called mBASIS. 

 mBASIS is a dollar-denominated ERC-20 token designed to deliver yield through a delta-neutral basis trading strategy, Midas said Thursday. Delta-neutral basis trading involves profiting from price gaps between the spot and perpetual futures markets. By going long in the spot market and short in the perpetual futures market for the same amount (or vice versa, if futures are lower than spot), the trade captures the price difference, or basis, as profit while maintaining a delta-neutral position. 

 The mBASIS token is similar to Ethena Labs' yield-bearing token, sUSDe (a staked version of its USDe ""synthetic dollar""), which also uses a delta-neutral basis trading strategy to generate yield. Since launching earlier this year, sUSDe has quickly grown in popularity and currently leads the yield-bearing tokens category with a market cap of $1.65 billion, according to The Block's Data Dashboard. 

 Midas decided to launch mBASIS because it felt it could build a better product than Ethena Labs, Fabrice Grinda, executive chairman of Midas, told The Block. 

 Midas currently already offers mTBILL, a yield-bearing stablecoin backed by U.S. Treasurys, which is a more suitable product for bear markets. However, in bull markets, people seek yield beyond the risk-free rate that is offered by mTBILL, Grinda said. 

 ""In bull markets, people expect the price of bitcoin and ether to rise in the future. You can generate yield by buying the spot and shorting futures. When the market is extraordinarily frothy as it was in March this generated annual returns upwards of 50%,"" Grinda, co-founder and former CEO of Aucland, Zingy and OLX, and a serial angel investor, said.  

 mBASIS vs Ethena's sUSDe 

 mBASIS differs from Ethena's sUSDe in more ways than one, Midas founder Dennis Dinkelmeyer, a former investment research analyst at Goldman Sachs, told The Block. Dinkelmeyer said that, unlike Ethena's product, mBASIS is managed by ""a leading, licensed asset manager who operates under a fiduciary duty, ensuring that the investment process aligns with the best interests of investors,"" declining to name the asset manager. He added that mBASIS has an independent regulated fund administrator, NAV Consulting. 

 mBASIS also provides bankruptcy protection, as client assets are held in a bankruptcy-protected special purpose vehicle, Dinkelmeyer said. In the event of a default, a security agent would distribute assets to creditors.  

 The mBASIS token is ""fully compliant with European securities regulations,"" according to Dinkelmeyer, who said this compliance ensures investor protection and legal certainty and makes mBASIS a ""more transparent option compared to Ethena's product."" 

 How mBASIS works 

 The mBASIS token dynamically adjusts basis positions across bitcoin, ether and the top 20 altcoins. While basis trading strategies typically perform well in bull markets due to positive funding rates, mBASIS switches to reverse basis trading or to mTBILL during adverse market conditions. 

 ""This flexibility ensures mBASIS remains an attractive investment under various market conditions,"" Dinkelmeyer said. ""In early June, the mBASIS APY [annual percentage yield] was around 20%. Currently, the APY is approximately 12%. The yield varies with market conditions,"" he added. 

 Overall, Dinkelmeyer said that mBASIS aims to achieve above-market returns by actively allocating to basis positions in the top 20 altcoins, which typically offer higher returns than bitcoin and ether. 

 mBASIS has already collected a seeding amount that is currently being invested, totaling ""several million dollars"" in total value locked (TVL), Dinkelmeyer said. He expects the TVL to exceed $100 million by this year's end for both of Midas' tokens, mBASIS and mTBILL. The latter currently has a TVL of about $7 million, according to Midas' website. 

 Both mBASIS and mTBILL are unavailable to U.S. persons and entities or those from sanctioned jurisdictions. The minimum investment amount currently for both products is 100,000 euros (over $107,000). Certain investors, such as qualified investors, may be able to invest at lower minimum amounts. 

 Midas is backed by high-profile investors, including Coinbase Ventures, GSR and BlockTower Capital. The Berlin, Germany-based startup raised $8.75 million in funding in March.

 Measuring Trends in Institutional Interest in Crypto 

 Since 2019, the crypto-focused subset of Fidelity’s institutional business has published a survey called the “Institutional Investor Digital Assets Study,” measuring trends in sentiment and adoption of crypto investing among institutional investors globally. 

 Overall, the 2023 survey depicts a generally sturdy but still mixed institutional outlook toward crypto on the back of a turbulent 2022. 

 Trends Reflecting Positive Sentiment 

 Trends Reflecting Negative Sentiment 

 It’s important to note the latest survey only spans May 30, 2023, to Oct. 6, 2023, missing a critical year-end period during which bitcoin rose from approximately $28,000 to $42,300, driven largely by anticipation of the SEC’s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs which occurred later, in January of 2024. Perceptions have likely evolved meaningfully since the start of 2024 following crypto’s market capitalization climbing above $2.5 trillion, Bitcoin surging to nearly $74,000, and the SEC’s approval of bitcoin and soon Ether spot ETFs. 

 What to look for in 2024 

 Arguably, the biggest market moments in the history of digital assets occurred after this survey was conducted, namely actions that reduce regulatory uncertainty, which may, in turn, reduce price volatility and improve investment options for investors. 

 Will the surprise SEC approval of spot Ether ETFs diminish regulatory concerns among institutions? 

 The digital asset market has begun transitioning from early adoption to mass adoption. A sea change in industry leadership, product development, and fiduciary commitment swept crypto in 2023 and early into 2024, enabling a new suite of increasingly institutional-grade on-ramps into the asset class. This change may take time to permeate through to institutional allocations more foundationally, but the rapid adoption of spot bitcoin ETFs following the SEC’s approval (aggregate ETF AUM doubled from approximately $30 billion in January to nearly $60 billion as of mid-June) may provide early indications of stronger institutional interest in crypto. 

 Will concerns about price volatility persist? 

 Volatility for the digital asset class remains elevated compared to other asset classes, but it has trended down over time and may continue to do so as improving regulatory conditions and institution-friendly product offerings potentially stabilize markets. Investors should also consider not just crypto volatility but the risk-adjusted return profile of various blockchain assets. 

 Will institutional investments flow primarily into spot BTC and ETH ETFs, or will they be spread across investment structures (SMAs, private funds, VC) offering diversified exposure to blockchain assets beyond the two mega caps? 

 Supported by major advances in industry infrastructure in 2023 spanning custody, trading, and asset management, investors now have a better – but still nascent – array of product options and investment platforms to not only help avoid the pitfalls of early-adopter risk but also to exploit early-adopter premia. These options, in addition to ETFs, include the increasingly prevalent SMA direct-index vehicle. 

 With the combined surge in blockchain data providers and the growing presence of systematic digital asset managers, will institutions become more familiar with crypto fundamentals and methods of digital asset valuation? 

 Some 37% of 2023 respondents cited a “lack of fundamentals to gauge appropriate value” as a barrier to investing. This large number reflects the asset class's emerging nature and the learning curve associated with measuring blockchain value. However, this number is down from 44% in 2021. It may continue to fall as investors become increasingly familiar with blockchain technology and the unique ways to analyze a protocol’s value to users.

 Ask an Expert 

 Q: What else should I be thinking about aside from buying and holding Bitcoin? 

 A: If clients want exposure to digital assets, it’s advisable to diversify that exposure, as you would with traditional assets. Bitcoin should be the core of every portfolio. Still, consideration is increasingly being given to ETH and SOL, given that Ethereum is becoming the chain of choice for institutional applications and Solana is for consumer payment applications. Financial advisors should not leave their clients’ assets on exchanges but utilize secure custody solutions to retain ownership and access to their client’s assets. 

 Q: Should I get exposure through ETFs? 

 A: While ETFs are convenient for retail investors, they lack the flexibility and opportunities available from holding actual digital assets. Digital assets trade 24/7, unlike ETFs, which only trade during market hours. Moreover, ETFs do not enable yield generation, which can be an attractive income stream and cannot be used as collateral for borrowing. For clients with large BTC portfolios, borrowing against their digital assets may be preferable to selling and incurring capital gains tax. 

 Q. Which client demographic are digital assets most suitable for? 

 A: Understanding the suitability of digital assets requires assessing clients' risk tolerance and wealth management goals. For low-risk clients, digital assets may serve as a store of value, with opportunities to generate attractive yields through staking. High-risk clients may instead desire access to venture capital investments in early-stage blockchain projects or higher-yielding DeFi investment strategies. Tailoring these approaches to individual needs helps integrate digital assets into a comprehensive wealth management plan.

 Saylor revealed that MicroStrategy has bolstered its cryptocurrency reserves by acquiring an additional 11,931 BTC, amounting to over $786 million. This was financed through the proceeds from convertible notes and excess cash, purchasing the BTC coins at an average price of approximately $65,883 per BTC. 

 MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 11,931 BTC for ~$786.0M using proceeds from convertible notes & excess cash for ~$65,883 per #bitcoin. As of 6/20/24, $MSTR hodls 226,331 $BTC acquired for ~$8.33B at average price of $36,798 per bitcoin.https://t.co/jE9dGqqnON— Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) June 20, 2024 

 The said 11,931 Bitcoin were acquired between April 27 and June 19, according to a filing on Thursday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Notably, this is MicroStrategy’s third largest acquisition of Bitcoin following its $821 million purchase of 12,000 tokens on March 11. 

 This substantial acquisition adds to MicroStrategy's already significant Bitcoin holdings. As of June 20, 2024, the company now holds a total of 226,331 BTC, acquired for over $8.33 billion at an average price of $36,798 per Bitcoin. 

 MicroStrategy's decision to expand its Bitcoin stash coincides with a period of lackluster price movements for the crypto market. Bitcoin has slightly eased after an impressive rally that took it to all-time highs of above $73,000 in mid-March. At the time of writing, BTC was down 0.18% in the last 24 hours to $64,859, extending its sell-off for this week. 

 MicroStrategy's aggressive investment strategy has positioned it as a leading corporate holder of Bitcoin, reflecting a strong belief in the cryptocurrency's value proposition. 

 Saylor started buying Bitcoin in 2020 as an inflation hedge and cash alternative. The biggest cryptocurrency has increased by nearly 600% since Saylor began purchasing it. Furthermore, the decision to buy Bitcoin has boosted MicroStrategy's stock price, which has risen by more than 1,000% since Saylor's decision.

u_today:25479c31a094b:0,Max Keiser Issues Warning to Argentina's President Against Ethereum,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 15:43:00 GMT",U.Today,"Argentinian President Javier Milei has expressed his support for the free competition of currencies, including Bitcoin. This announcement has been well received by many in the cryptocurrency community. However, Max Keiser, a well-known Bitcoin advocate and advisor to the president of El Salvador, has advised Milei to be cautious about including other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum. 

 Keiser has described ETH as a scam, warning that its inclusion could slow Argentina's progress in the digital currency sector. He suggests that while Milei's endorsement of BTC is a positive step, the president should reconsider his stance on supporting multiple cryptocurrencies. 

 According to Keiser, many Bitcoin enthusiasts initially supported various digital currencies before eventually focusing solely on BTC. 

 Keiser, Bitcoin, Argentina 

 This is not the first time Keiser has criticized Milei's crypto policy. He previously raised concerns about Milei's decision to mandate the registration of all Bitcoin and crypto platforms in Argentina, arguing that this approach could have negative repercussions due to what he perceives as a lack of deep understanding of Bitcoin's unique characteristics. 

 Despite these criticisms, President Milei remains committed to his vision of a free market where individuals and businesses can choose their preferred currency. He believes that allowing the use of different units, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, will spur innovation and economic growth. 

 Earlier this year, Argentina took an important step by removing taxes on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, signaling a shift toward a more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets.

 This indirect confirmation came in response to a playful tweet by a Dogecoin graphic designer, ""dogedesigner,"" who shared that 'lil X' is a dedicated toddler holder, never once suggesting selling his holdings. 

 It’s true! 😂— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 20, 2024 

 ""X is a toddler hodler. Never once has he said sell,"" Dogedesigner tweeted. Musk reacted with an affirmation, accompanied by a laughter emoji. This lighthearted confirmation quickly caught the attention of the crypto community. 

 Bought some Dogecoin for lil X, so he can be a toddler hodler— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 10, 2021 

 This interaction has sparked a wave of reactions from the crypto community, with an X (formerly Twitter) user sharing a throwback to Musk's tweet from Feb. 10, 2021, which read, ""Bought some Dogecoin for lil X, so he can be a toddler hodler."" Another X user responded by asking, ""how many Doge X has?"" 

 The Dogecoin community has long been influenced by Musk's tweets, often seeing immediate market reactions to his statements. His latest tweet is no exception, as it has once again put the spotlight on Dogecoin. 

 Musk, who touted himself as the ""Dogefather,"" has been a strong supporter of Dogecoin, frequently mentioning it in his tweets and even allowing it as a payment option for certain Tesla merchandise. 

 In May, Musk tweeted about the passing of the dog Kabosu, the face of the DOGE meme, which saw the Dogecoin price spike shortly after. 

 At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price was trading down 0.08% in the last 24 hours to $0.122, yet to post a reaction to the current attention it is receiving.

cointelegraph:2b1006370094b:0,Mirror World CEO shares insights on building a Solana game engine after securing $12M raise,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 15:33:34 GMT",Cointelegraph,"Despite the blockchain's soaring popularity, there is a chronic ""lack of infrastructure"" for developers to build games on Solana, at least according to Mirror World CEO Chris Zhu. 

 In an interview with Cointelegraph, Zhu stated that certain DeFi features taken for granted on other blockchains, such as cross-chain swaps and on/off crypto ramps, are simply out of reach for Solana gaming developers. ""For example, applications like games find it challenging to internalize value on a shared Solana layer not designed with just one application in mind,"" said Zhu, continuing: ""Specific applications may require custom features such as Privacy, Instant settlements, Asset transfer rules and compliance which were not supported."" 

 To combat this problem, a few days prior, Solana gaming studio Mirror World Labs raised $12 million in its inaugural Series A funding led by Bitkraft, Galaxy Interactive, Big Brain Holdings, and others to further the development of its gaming rollup, Sonic, which launched back in March.  

 Zhu says that thus far, developers have been receptive to Sonic's technical capacity. ""However, some of their feedback was to have the main token liquidity on Solana mainnet,"" he said. ""Which is why we enabled atomic interoperability. Leveraging HyperGrid Framework (a rollup deployment kit that allows developers to deploy new game engines and virtual machines within the Solana environment), games can utilize atomic interoperability, which allows liquidity to remain on the mainnet while processing game logic on Sonic."" 

 Currently, Mirror World is targeting a controlled aggregated transaction settlement of 12,000,000 transactions per second on Sonic and HyperGrid, which would support a variety of multi-player real-time gaming transactions such as inventory purchases, quest drops, and more.  

 ""In order to achieve this, we also needed to work directly with Solana validators to prioritize and submit our transactions - which is where our investor Galaxy Interactive has been playing a big role, as the largest validator on Solana,"" Zhu said. 

 Cointelegraph: Looking ahead, what are the key milestones and new features that Mirror World plans to introduce to further support and expand the Solana gaming ecosystem? 

 Chris Zhu: As a layer-two blockchain, we are actively expanding all the relevant components to build out a healthy, sustainable, and growing ecosystem. This not only includes gaming studios, but all the infrastructure projects to enable and bring in liquidity, such as NFT marketplaces, DEXes, staking protocols, etc. Additionally, we are positioned to be the gaming hub of Solana - supporting our gaming studios on all fronts, including go-to-market support, regional marketing, partnership collaboration, KOL engagements, and more to maximize the growth of our ecosystem games. 

 Currently, Sonic remains the only software development kit (SDK) on Solana. Its closest competitor, Eclipse, instead seeks to build a Solana Virtual Machine later-two on Ethereum, and not a Solana-native SDK on its own blockchain. ""There is also Ronin (Web3 Games) and Redstone (FOCG), which is the leading gaming chain on top of Ethereum, but we aim to bring gaming assets and developers that want to build on Solana Virtual Machine,"" Zhu commented. 

 Mirror World developers told Cointelegraph previously that while Solana has benefited from the memecoin boom and decentralized application market growth, its gaming aspect “has not seen similar levels of success.” They believe that the novel Sonic protocol could help other devs in deploying Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) chains to support their own GameFi projects.

beincrypto:76a5afc95094b:0,"WLD Price Surges 14% as Worldcoin Launches in Ecuador, Plans Return to Kenya","Thu, 20 Jun 2024 15:24:49 GMT",Beincrypto,"Worldcoin, the crypto project co-founded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, is expanding its reach by introducing its World ID orb verifications in Ecuador. 

 This move is a significant step as the project also prepares to resume operations in Kenya after a year-long suspension due to regulatory concerns. 

 Worldcoin Gains Momentum with Ecuador Launch and Kenya Clearance 

 Starting June 26, Worldcoin will offer orb verifications at six locations in Guayaquil and Quito. This initiative allows Ecuadorians aged 18 and older to join the 5.7 million participants in the Worldcoin network. 

 The launch in Ecuador comes amid rising global support for technologies that verify human identity online. Recent surveys conducted by Tools for Humanity (TFH), a Worldcoin contributor, show strong support for these technologies. 

 In Ecuador, most respondents support technology-based solutions to distinguish humans from bots online. This finding aligns with Worldcoin’s aim to address the growing problem of online bots and fraud. 

 Worldcoin’s expansion into Ecuador also coincides with its growth plans in Argentina, which aim to make Argentina its hub in Latin America. This effort includes substantial investment and the creation of professional opportunities for at least 50 qualified developers, operations specialists, software engineers, and data analysts. 

 In a parallel development, Worldcoin has received clearance to resume its iris-scanning operations in Kenya. Local media reported that the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) issued a letter on June 14, closing the investigation that halted Worldcoin’s activities nearly a year ago. 

 “The resultant investigation file was forwarded to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for an independent review and advice. Upon review of the file, the Director of Public Prosecutions concurred and directed that the file be closed with no further police action,” it reported. 

 Still, the DCI emphasized the need for Worldcoin to register its business and acquire necessary licenses. Additionally, it stressed the importance of Worldcoin in vetting its vendors for continued operations. 

 Kenya was one of the initial countries for Worldcoin’s iris-scanning scheme, which aimed to create a new identity and cryptocurrency system. However, operations were suspended shortly after the launch due to regulatory concerns about data protection and the legality of its services. 

 The suspension led to a parliamentary investigation recommending shutting down Worldcoin’s operations. The investigation cited data protection and consumer protection law violations and concerns over espionage and state security. It found that Worldcoin and its affiliates were not registered businesses in Kenya and lacked approval for their orb hardware. 

 TFH’s Chief Legal Officer, Thomas Scott, expressed gratitude for the fair investigation. He also reiterated the company’s commitment to working with the Kenyan government. Furthermore, he emphasized that the investigation’s closure marks a new beginning for Worldcoin in Kenya. 

 “We will continue working with the Government of Kenya and others and we hope to resume World ID registration across the country soon. For today, we are just pleased to return our focus to advancing Worldcoin’s mission: creating opportunities for people in Kenya and elsewhere to participate in the global economy,” he said. 

 Nonetheless, Worldcoin and TFH still face investigations in other countries, including Spain and Germany. 

 Recent developments caused Worldcoin’s native token, WLD, to experience a 14.44% increase in value, rising from $2.77 to $3.17. However, at the time of writing, the price of WLD has retreated to $2.97.

u_today:eacf1cc20094b:0,"Toncoin (TON) Playing Catch up With Bitcoin, Transactions Go Parabolic","Thu, 20 Jun 2024 15:21:00 GMT",U.Today,"Toncoin (TON), the native digital asset of The Open Network, is competing with Bitcoin’s BTCUSD dominance, with parabolic movements in a key on-chain metric. Within the past 24 hours, TON’s price increased by 5.3% to trade at $7.24. 

 Toncoin competing with Bitcoin 

 Renowned data analytics platform CryptoQuant says the transfer volume for TON ranges between $5 billion to $10 billion.  

 On-chain metrics of $TON are going parabolic! 

 “The transfer volume ranges between $5.0B ~ $10.0B. For comparison, #Bitcoin's average daily transfer volume is around $50.0B. This indicates that #TON has already achieved between 10% Bitcoin's capacity.” – By @JA_Maartun  

 Read… pic.twitter.com/56VjsAGOwL— CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 20, 2024 

 To put this in perspective, Bitcoin, the world’s leading crypto, boasts an average daily transfer volume of about $50 billion. This translates to TON capturing roughly 10% of Bitcoin's capacity, a remarkable feat for a project that launched only four years ago. 

 Additionally, TON is witnessing a steady increase in its number of holders. On-chain data shows a 10x increase in token holders over the past year, jumping from 2.9 million to a current count of 32 million. This rise in adoption suggests a growing interest in the TON ecosystem and its potential applications. 

 Moreover, the TON blockchain has seen increased activity from large investors, popularly known as whales. According to an earlier report by U.Today, whale activity for Toncoin has surged by an impressive 376%. At the time of this writing, the market capitalization of TON has grown to $17.7 billion, eclipsing Cardano’s ADAUSD $14 billion. 

 Possible factors fueling TON’s growing adoption 

 The development of applications and functionalities built on the TON blockchain could be a key factor fueling its growth. TON is currently hosting over 650 decentralized applications (dApps) of various types. Notable success has been seen in its ""Tap-to-Earn"" apps like Notcoin (NOT), TapSwap and Hamster Kombat (HAMSTER), which is fueling interest in it on the market. 

 Also, TON offers unique features like lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees, which could be attracting users to the platform. As the crypto market continues to evolve, Toncoin’s long-term success lies in its ability to sustain critical support levels.

 ""Spot bitcoin ETFs have contributed to an 80% increase in open interest on the CME bitcoin futures market year-to-date,"" CF Benchmarks lead research analyst Gabriel Selby told The Block. 

 Selby added that this institutional investor activity could drive bitcoin liquidity and ""set the stage for a more robust and interconnected market ecosystem.""  

 Record number of futures contracts on CME after spot ETF approval 

 CF Benchmarks data show there are currently just under 18,000 bitcoin short contracts on the CME (at a notional of around $6.3 billion). ""This is way above the record prior to spot bitcoin ETF approval in October 2021 of approximately 6,200 short contracts,"" Selby said. 

 Record number of bitcoin short contracts on the CME after spot bitcoin ETF approval. Image: CF Benchmarks. 

 Selby attributed this increase to basis trading that uses the alignment of price benchmarks between spot bitcoin ETFs and CME futures contracts to facilitate arbitrage opportunities. 

 Basis trading pressure on spot bitcoin price 

 The arbitrage opportunities between trading the difference between the spot and futures price can put pressure on the current bitcoin spot price. When the bitcoin futures price is higher than the spot price, buying in the spot market increases the spot price, while selling in the futures market decreases the futures price. 

 Conversely, when the futures price is lower than the spot price, selling in the spot market decreases the spot price, while buying in the futures market increases the futures price. 

 However, arbitrage activities typically have a short-term impact on the spot price, as the spot and futures prices will converge over time.  

 The CF Benchmarks analyst said that it is hard to say with certainty exactly how much spot bitcoin ETF is being used in the aggregate for the basis trade. ""While it will be within the ball park of the $6 billion notional on the CME side,"" the analyst said.

beincrypto:7dc8698cf094b:0,Binance to Delist OCEAN and AGIX in Support for Artificial Superintelligence Alliance,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 14:59:36 GMT",Beincrypto,"The largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Binance, will delist and suspend Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) and SingularityNET AGIXUSDT tokens in support for Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) merger. 

 AI crypto coins are rallying on the back of this news, with AGIX, OCEAN, and FET leading by double digits. 

 Binance Delists Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET 

 Binance has announced that it will support the ASI token alliance. The first act of support will be to delist Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET native tokens, OCEAN and AGIX, respectively. The action, effective July 1, will mean ceasing trading for the tokens and suspending all deposits and withdrawals. 

 “At 2024-07-01 03:30 (UTC), deposits and withdrawals of Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) and SingularityNET AGIXUSDT will be suspended. Please ensure that you leave sufficient time for your OCEAN and AGIX deposits to be fully processed prior to this time,” the announcement states. 

 Binance has also committed to handle all technical requirements for AGIX and OCEAN holders. The two tokens will assume the ticker of FET at Binance, swapped at a ratio of 1 OCEAN to 0.433226 FET for the Ocean Protocol and 1 AGIX to 0.433350 FET for the SingularityNET token. 

 As BeInCrypto reported in late March, Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol committed to entering a definitive merger agreement. Under the terms of the contract, their respective utility tokens, FET, AGIX, and OCEAN, would become one ASI. Effectively, they would achieve “the largest open-source, independent player in AI research and development.” 

 This strategic move aims to foster the development of a decentralized AI platform, a vision shared by all parties. Despite the merger of their tokens into the ASI token, SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol will maintain their operational independence. However, they will collaborate under the umbrella of the Superintelligence Collective. This new coalition will be led by Ben Goertzel, the founder and CEO of SingularityNET. 

 The convergence of the three entities reflects the escalating race among AI-oriented platforms to pioneer decentralized AI technology. The goal is to move away from the control of tech giants like Alphabet and Microsoft and ensure that corporations do not solely prioritize shareholder interests. 

 FET, AGIX, OCEAN Tokens Rally 

 FET, AGIX, and OCEAN are rallying on the back of this news, significantly outperforming their peers in the sector. AI tokens have seen gains upwards of 30%, showcasing market confidence. 

 A look at the FET/USDT trading pair in the 1-day timeframe shows a strong resolve among the bulls. This is demonstrated by the bullish crossover when the Relative Strength Index (RSI) crosses above its signal line (yellow band). 

 The RSI crossover is considered a buy signal. The large green nodes on the volume profile reinforce it. Together, they signify positive sentiment in the FET market. The Parabolic Stop and Reverse (SAR) indicator is trailing the Fetch.ai price from below. As long as this price tracking indicator trails the asset from below, the token remains bullish.

cointelegraph:1426af2e1094b:0,Polkadot's new proposal to slash unstaking time to 2 days ,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 14:54:15 GMT",Cointelegraph,"Web3 Foundation (W3F) researchers have introduced a new Request for Comments (RFC)-0092 proposal to reduce the unbonding periods for staked tokens on Polkadot. 

 The new mechanism proposes reducing the unstaking process from 28 days to as little as two days — geared toward improving user convenience and competitiveness without compromising security. 

 Related: Gavin Wood introduces JAM as Polkadot’s new hybrid transactionless blockchain model 

 Proposed unstaking overhaul 

 The W3F-proposed mechanism involves the unbonding system that queues unbonding requests and scales the duration based on the queue size.  

 If the proposal passes to the voting phase and is approved, the new system will allow the minimum duration to be reduced to just two days when the queue is empty.  

 The system would prevent unbonding time from exceeding the current fixed period of 28 days and provide users with a faster and more efficient unstaking process. Cointelegraph 

 Driving factors  

 The driving factor behind the introduction of RFC-0092 is that Polkadot has one of the longest unbonding periods among proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols. 

 Despite the high annual percentage yield (APY) offered by staking on Polkadot, the long unstaking process can potentially deter participation as users opt for faster alternatives. 

 Related: Polkadot active addresses hit record 600K 

 Simulation analysis 

 The proposed unbonding queue mechanism was accompanied by an empirical analysis to simulate the new system’s potential. 

 The simulation indicated that the average unbonding time would drop to approximately 2.67 days while the system remains sensitive to large unbonding events without exceeding the 28-day upper limit.

beincrypto:7e7575854094b:0,Axie Infinity (AXS) Price Could Be Primed for a 96% Drop,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 14:48:45 GMT",Beincrypto,"Axie Infinity (AXS) price is leaning more towards a bearish outcome wherein the existing losses will likely intensify. 

 Investors could catalyze this with early selling as they move to offset their losses. 

 Axie Infinity Investors’ Skepticism Spikes 

 Owing to the drawdown in the AXS price, less than 11% of all AXS holders are currently in profit. This is because the broader market bearish conditions weigh heavily on the altcoin. This is the lowest figure clocked by gaming token investors in eight months since October 2023. 

 The unfavorable market conditions could trigger a wave of selling as investors look to offset their losses. This potential sell-off may exacerbate the downward pressure on AXS, leading to further price declines. 

 Furthermore, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator is at a yearly low. CMF is a technical analysis indicator that measures the strength of buying and selling pressure in a market by combining price and volume data.  

 A positive CMF indicates buying pressure, while a negative CMF suggests selling pressure. The CMF’s current reading suggests that the market is experiencing significant outflows of capital. This is owing to rising selling pressure, which could hinder any attempts at recovery for AXS price. 

 AXS Price Prediction: Watching a Breakdown 

 AXS price is forming a head and shoulders pattern at the moment. This is a classic bearish indicator, as the formation often precedes significant price corrections. Changing hands at $6.1 at the time of writing, it appears that AXS could be poised for further declines. 

 The head-and-shoulders pattern suggests a potential 96% correction for AXS. If this pattern plays out as expected, AXS price could plummet, resulting in substantial losses for holders. 

 However, the more practical outlook for the altcoin is a drawdown to $4.0. This price point has been tested as a support floor in the past, and the altcoin will likely land here. 

 But if the gaming token bounces back from support at $5.3, it could initiate recovery. Reclaiming $7 as support would trigger the recovery rally and invalidate the bearish thesis.

newsbtc:a9d120770094b:0,"Cardano Bucks Bears As Large Transactions Climb To $10 Billion, Can This Drive Price To $1?","Thu, 20 Jun 2024 14:30:35 GMT",NewsBTC,"The Cardano decline in the past week seems to be coming to an end, as evidenced by on-chain data. While the overall crypto market has been in a slump, Cardano is starting to buck the trend. ADA, Cardano’s native token, has seen a huge surge in on-chain transactions from large holders, indicating sporadic activity and interest in the blockchain. Notably, transaction data shows that Cardano has registered over $10 billion worth of large transactions in the past 24 hours, representing a 26% increase within the time frame. Furthermore, this puts the worth of ADA large transactions at $32.54 billion in the past seven days. 

 Cardano Large Transactions Climb To $10 Billion in 24 Hours 

 Cardano, like most altcoins, has been going through a turbulent price action since the beginning of the month. This decline was further exacerbated by Bitcoin’s drop below $65,000 in the past 48 hours. However, Cardano now seems to be building bullish momentum, particularly from large holders. In the past 24 hours alone, 27.17 billion ADA, amounting to $10.43 billion, was traded between large holders, according to ITB. 

 Interestingly, the number of Cardano large transactions jumped to 851 in the past 24 hours, which is a 107% increase from 410 of such transactions recorded on June 16th. 

 IntoTheBlock’s large transaction metric measures the number of transactions larger than $100,000 on the blockchain. It’s worth noting that while activity from this cohort has grown in the last 24 hours, it remains considerably below the transaction peak of 95,730 set on May 29. 

 Can The Activity Push ADA To $1? 

 With activity from large holders starting to increase, a natural question is whether this can translate to significant price appreciation for ADA. Many analysts think ADA still has plenty of room to run if the crypto market recovers and turns bullish again. Cardano, for one, now has its 30-day MVRV ratio at -12.6%, which is a very bullish indicator for a bounce in the short term. 

 At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.3915 and is up by a meager 0.45% in the past 24 hours. Interestingly, recent price action shows ADA bouncing off a 7-month low of $0.3685 on June 18. 

 The journey to $1 seems tough at the moment, and there are many price resistance levels to overcome. The first step is to push above the $0.400 resistance level. Failure to push above could lead to the start of another decline to $0.37. However, ADA reached an all-time high of $3.10 in September 2021, so reclaiming $1 is not yet out of the game.

cointelegraph:5ec9f547d094b:0,"Kraken recovers $3 million from CertiK, ending bug bounty saga ","Thu, 20 Jun 2024 14:30:31 GMT",Cointelegraph,"Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has recovered missing funds following a high-profile bug bounty exploit fiasco.  

 Kraken confirmed the return of the stolen digital assets worth nearly $3 million, putting an end to the Kraken-Certik saga that started on June 9. 

 The recovery of the funds, minus transaction fees, was confirmed by Nicholas Percoco, chief security officer of Kraken, in a June 20 X post: 

 Kraken’s CSO first announced the $3 million worth of missing funds on June 19, when he claimed that a “security researcher” maliciously withdrew them from the treasury after discovering and sharing an existing bug. 

 Kraken claimed that it was extorted by the security researcher who was refusing to return the funds, demanding a reward and a call with the exchange’s business development team. 

 CertiK's side of the story 

 Shortly after Kraken’s post about the missing funds, blockchain security firm CertiK publicly identified itself as the “security researcher” that Kraken claimed stole $3 million of digital assets. 

 In a June 19 X post, CertiK said it had informed Kraken of an exploit that allowed it to remove millions of dollars from the exchange’s accounts. Certik also claimed to have been threatened by the exchange’s team: 

 The security firm posted a timeline of events, starting with identifying the exploit on June 5 and ending with claims Kraken threatened a CertiK employee on June 18. In a statement to Cointelegraph, CertiK said it planned to transfer the funds “to an account that Kraken will be able to access.” Cointelegraph 

 Why did CertiK withdraw nearly $3 million? 

 Kraken’s CSO initially said that the first malicious transfer, worth just $4, would have been sufficient to prove the bug and collect “sizable rewards” from Karken’s bounty program.  

 However, the security researcher, which was later disclosed as CertiK, had minted nearly $3 million into their Kraken accounts.  

 In a post following the return of the $3 million, CertiK said that the multi-million sum was necessary to test the limits of the exchange: 

 Moreover, CertiK claims that it didn’t initially request a bounty, but it was something mentioned by the exchange: 

 CertiK added that no Kraken user funds were endangered since the exploited funds were “minted out of air.”

 Shares of the cryptocurrency exchange-traded product issuer (ETP), plummeted in recent days following steep declines in altcoins and a negative opinion piece in a crypto newsletter. 

 Benchmark's analyst Mark Palmer wrote that the stock had gained more than 330% since the beginning of May; it then lost almost half of its value over two days before recovering much of that loss yesterday afternoon. 

 Most of the ETPs that DeFi offers are altcoin focused, and the slump in these tokens earlier in the week had a negative impact on the share price, Palmer said. 

 The pullback might be partially due to traders taking some profit off the table after the recent outsized rally, but the sell-off appears overdone, and the stock’s significant repricing offers an “attractive buying opportunity,” the report added. 

 Palmer reiterated his buy rating on the stock and a C$3 price target. The shares slipped as much as 17% in early trading on Thursday to around C$1.93 before rebounding near C$2, according to TradingView data. 

 “Volatility in the price of altcoins should not surprise anyone who has even a casual understanding of the dynamics of the crypto market,” Palmer wrote, adding that some weakness in the stock price due to the sell-off in these tokens was understandable. 

 DeFi has responded to the negative article published by CoinSnacks, describing it as a “misleading short and distort report,” the note added.

This was hinted at by Bitstamp in a post on social network X.  

 Thus, the European exchange, which will soon be under Robinhood's umbrella following the latter's acquisition announcement earlier this month, responded to questions about WIF's price and availability on Robinhood US, suggesting that the current price of $2.06 is just the beginning, with an imminent listing hinted at. 

 ⏳ ⏳— Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) June 19, 2024 

 Robinhood's move to buy Bitstamp, a big player on the European crypto exchange scene with over 50 licenses worldwide, puts it in a great position to expand its offerings, including Dogwifhat. 

 No Coinbase, No problem 

 For Dogwifhat, a potential listing on Robinhood US would be a big deal, along with its inclusion on Binance earlier this year. Despite its incredible growth since November 2023, when it first started as a fun tribute to an iconic dog in a hat, WIF still has not secured listings on major U.S. platforms outside of Kraken.  

 Many were expecting it to debut on Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, but that has not happened yet.WIF to USD by CoinMarketCap 

 Since it first started, Dogwifhat has gone from nothing to a valuation of $4.88 per token, with a market capitalization of $13 billion and a trading volume of $365 million. These numbers show how popular it is becoming, even though it started out as a meme. 

 With Robinhood's planned acquisition of Bitstamp and rumors of WIF being listed, industry watchers are bracing themselves for further developments that could shape Dogwifhat's future on the crypto market.

beincrypto:268354a5b094b:0,Donald Trump’s Former Advisor Clears the Air: Trump Not Involved With DJT Meme Coin,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 14:15:53 GMT",Beincrypto,"Roger Stone’s statement provides a crucial counterpoint to the ongoing allegations of the Trump family’s involvement. With substantial claims yet unverified, the crypto community remains cautiously observant. 

 Martin Shkreli Claims Donald Trump Liked the DJT Meme Coin 

 Amid these developments, contrasting views have emerged from other notable figures. Former New York legislator Ben Geller has expressed concerns about the coin’s link to Barron, referring to it as a potential PR disaster. 

 “I believe from reputable sources that Barron was [involved], then backed away once things were absolutely destroyed by the developer. This was a PR disaster,” Geller said. 

 Moreover, Martin Shkreli contradicts these clarifications by asserting that Barron had Donald Trump’s permission to initiate the meme coin project. Shkreli, known for his controversial background, revealed that the meme coin was developed on Barron’s computer. 

 “The attempt to evade and equivocate is just absurd. It doesn’t change the fact that there are 200 million bucks here. Nobody’s saying no to 200 million bucks in the Trump family,” Shkreli said. 

 Shkreli also insisted that he had no financial interest in the project, highlighting his advisory role. According to Shkreli, his involvement was primarily consultative, aimed at ensuring the success of the meme coin rather than securing immediate financial benefits. 

 Additionally, Shkreli shared insights into the operational aspects of the project, indicating that it was a collaborative endeavor. He also claimed that Barron Trump controls the private keys of the DJT meme coin. 

 In their planning stages, Shkreli and Barron engaged with key figures in the crypto ecosystem, including crypto influencer Ansem. 

 “We spoke with Ansem about five or six times. Initially, we thought having 70% of the supply in Trump’s hands would make sense,” Shkreli claimed. 

 However, after further discussions, they revised their strategy, ultimately deciding to allocate 50% in liquidity pools. This decision was influenced by feedback that demonstrated their initial plan was impractical. 

 In a bold statement, Shkreli suggested that Donald Trump approved the DJT meme coin. He implied that the former President was informally supportive of the venture. 

 “Barron told me his dad was in on it. His dad liked it,” Shkreli stated.

the_block:515ecf3b3094b:0,Modular blockchain Particle Network raises $15 million in token round,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 14:05:05 GMT",The Block,"Particle Network, a modular blockchain developer focused on chain abstraction technology, has raised $15 million in a Series A funding round. 

 The Spartan Group and Gumi Cryptos Capital co-led the round, with SevenX Ventures, Morningstar Ventures, Flow Traders, HashKey Capital and others participating, Particle Network said Thursday. 

 The project began raising funds for the Series A round in March and closed it last month, Particle founder and CEO Pengyu Wang told The Block. The round was structured as a simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT), Wang said, declining to comment on the valuation. 

 The Series A round brings Particle's total funding to $25 million — having previously raised $10 million across three funding rounds. 

 What is Particle Network? 

 Particle Network is a modular Layer 1 blockchain focused on chain abstraction technology, which simplifies developer and user experiences. 

 Particle's key offering is ""universal accounts,"" which allow users to use funds from any chain to transact across the blockchain ecosystem. Universal accounts are supported by two underlying functionalities — ""universal liquidity and universal gas"" — which enable users to spend their tokens across any chain and pay for gas or transaction fees in any of their tokens. 

 ""With universal accounts, users no longer need to bridge or manually manage accounts across chains, and developers can onboard users from anywhere in the ecosystem,"" Wang said. 

 Particle Network is currently in testnet phase 1 and claims to have already registered around 1.3 million universal accounts and over 114 million transactions. 

 Particle Network is built using the Cosmos SDK and made Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible with Berachain's BeaconKit framework, Wang said, adding that Particle's core competitors include NEAR (through its chain signatures technology) and Polygon's AggLayer (through its chain unification technology). 

 While Particle is now focused on chain abstraction, its first offering was wallet abstraction technology that helped developers onboard users via social logins instead of typical crypto wallets. Particle said its wallet abstraction technology has been integrated by over 900 decentralized applications, securing over $2 billion worth of user assets. 

 Particle network mainnet and token launch 

 Particle Network's testnet phase 2 is expected to launch this week, with the mainnet launch scheduled for the third quarter of this year, Wang said. The Particle token, PARTI, will also launch alongside the mainnet, Wang added. 

 With fresh funding in place, Particle looks to expand its current team of over 30 people to more than 40, Wang said, adding that the project is hiring for roles in the engineering and operations functions. 

 Particle also plans to onboard more developers, public blockchains and decentralized applications utilizing its chain abstraction technology, Wang said, adding that the project also looks to grow its community through marketing initiatives.

cointelegraph:86e165899094b:0, SEC drops Ethereum investigation to avoid ‘embarrassing’ court case ,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 14:03:00 GMT",Cointelegraph,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) case to prove Ether is a security may not have been as strong as it let on. 

 On June 19, 2024, the SEC surprised the crypto industry when it officially closed its investigation into whether Ether ETHUSD is a security.  

 Consensys lawyer Laura Brookover said there will be “no more protestations from the SEC that Ether is a security.” 

 Brookover claimed that the SEC didn’t willingly decide to drop the investigation. 

 She said it was a reaction to being pushed to “lift the subpoenas on Consensys given their recent ETH [exchange-traded fund] rule change approvals predicated on ETH being a commodity.” 

 The letter from Consensys states that the SEC’s approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) indicated that it had “updated its position to classify ETH as a commodity and not a security.”  

 The SEC has not publicly confirmed Consensys’ thesis.  

 ETF is no guarantee that Ether is a commodity 

 Carol Goforth, a professor at the University of Arkansas School of Law who specializes in business associations and securities regulation, told Cointelegraph that the SEC’s approval of a spot Ether ETF does not mean ETH is a commodity. 

 Goforth said that the “approval of an ETF has nothing to do with whether the underlying asset is a security.”  

 She added that there are already ETFs with commodities as the underlying asset: 

 If the spot Ether ETF approval doesn’t necessarily force the SEC to demonstrate that ETH is a security, why did the SEC halt its investigation? 

 Why did the SEC drop the investigation into Ethereum? 

 Goforth believes the SEC’s retreat is a “pretty good indication that the agency does not believe it can convince a court that ETH is a security.”  

 She suspects the SEC “concluded that it would be difficult to prove that ETH is a security under the Howey investment contract test because of how widely the asset is held and traded, and how much market forces dictate profitability.” She said that the SEC may have wanted to avoid a discomfiting defeat: 

 In 2018, former SEC director William Hinman stated that Ethereum was not a security.  

 In his speech, he mentioned that decentralization plays a key role in this determination. The network and its operations were sufficiently decentralized, meaning investors no longer expected a single entity to perform significant administrative efforts​.  

 Recent: Crypto clicker games need real token use cases to be sustainable 

 The speech suggested that Ethereum’s status as a non-security was clear, contrasting with the SEC’s ongoing scrutiny under Gensler.  

 The crypto industry’s main complaint is that the SEC has not consistently provided guidance on how the Howey test applies to Ethereum or other similar cryptocurrencies.  

 The battle for U.S. crypto regulation is far from over 

 The crypto community may be happy that the SEC dropped its investigation.  

 Goforth said that it’s a “really positive development for the Ethereum network that the SEC is not currently trying to asses that ETH is a security.”  

 However, she said that the letter from the SEC only states that “at this time,” the SEC will not be continuing its investigation and that “this is not a final determination.” 

 Goforth believes “it is too early to say the industry is ‘winning’ given the lingering uncertainties over the appropriate classification of most crypto assets.” 

 Consensys highlighted that despite this “momentous” victory, it’s not a “cure-all for the many blockchain developers, technology providers, and industry participants who have suffered under SEC’s unlawful and aggressive crypto enforcement regime.”Cointelegraph 

 Goforth claimed that the industry needs a “clear regulatory framework with which it is reasonably possible to comply” where purchasers can access accurate information, and industry participants can be held accountable for illicit activities. 

 Consensys may have won the battle, but the war continues. The SEC is also scrutinizing staking, a core element of the Ethereum ecosystem. 

 American crypto exchange Kraken has already settled with the SEC for $30 million. The exchange stopped offering staking services after the commission alleged that its staking-as-a-service offering constituted a security. 

 Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has even said that the exchange will take the SEC to court over staking if necessary.  

 Recent: TXSE ‘upstart’ stock exchange could become a crypto-friendly challenger 

 Goforth said that staking is “definitely a more complex” topic where “the SEC has alleged that staking itself involves an investment contract.”  

 She remarked that the SEC’s “position can be taken regardless of whether the underlying crypto asset is itself a security.”  

 The ongoing struggle for a clear regulatory framework in the U.S. crypto industry continues to be challenging.  

 However, recent developments might offer Ethereum advocates a momentary respite from some of the uncertainties surrounding Ether’s classification, offering a glimmer of hope in an otherwise tumultuous regulatory landscape.

coindesk:370abcc0d094b:0,Telegram Is Crypto’s Adoption Machine,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 14:02:33 GMT",CoinDesk,"Listen to any crypto podcast or convention panel, and you will hear crypto natives speak of a killer app yet to come that will onboard the rest of the world. But what if it is already here? I argue that Telegram and a handful of independent developers have made more progress in onboarding the masses to crypto than the $100 billion in venture capital that has flooded the space since 2014. 

 Crypto adoption has been hindered by (i) poor UX, (ii) limited real-world utility, and (iii) terrible distribution. Through its support for and integration of The Open Network (TON), Telegram is addressing all of these issues and more. 

 From a Crypto Enthusiast’s Perspective 

 Throughout its early development and up until recently, crypto focused on niche tech development that primarily served crypto speculators and lacked real-world utility. With the arrival of spot ETFs and firms such as BlackRock opening up funds focused on asset tokenization, the time for evolution is now. 

 Telegram combined its messaging app boasting 800 million monthly active users, a blockchain providing rails for crypto adoption in TON, and a native wallet bot known simply as Wallet. Many crypto pitch decks vaguely romanticize the notion of “merging Web2 and Web3,” Telegram is actually doing it. 

 With this combination, Telegram addresses the three core issues that held crypto back. In my view, stablecoins are crypto’s greatest product to date. With native USDT on TON since April, the seamless transfer of value P2P became a reality. Users can send crypto to their friends as easily as sending a message on WhatsApp. This is a smoother UX than neobanks like Venmo or Revolut, and lightyears ahead of traditional banks. 

 The opportunity for onboarding 100s of millions to crypto, however, likely comes through Telegram’s Mini Apps — an open platform for businesses to build and deploy crypto-friendly apps. This will enable crypto teams to distribute their product to non-crypto-natives while the end user will not necessarily know they are using a crypto product — whether that is a fun mobile game or a DeFi protocol. 

 From a Crypto Native’s Perspective 

 Telegram solidified its place in crypto long ago. It is a popular platform among crypto natives used to keep in touch or share ideas, and it is usually the first social media channel new crypto projects set up along with their X account. 

 Recently, it became more than that for on-chain traders. A new generation of Telegram trading bots changed crypto UX forever, and perhaps changed on-chain trading forever. Buying/selling, setting limit orders, scanning new projects, sniping new launches, and copy trading “smart money,” all became simple with a single command. 

 Having a Telegram bot comprehensively freeing me from the most frustrating UX issues of on-chain trading was a breath of fresh air. It was one of the very rare times a crypto product made me say “wow, this is great.” It did, however, make altcoin trading much more competitive and spurred on what I consider the “proliferation of altcoins.” 

 Does this mean altcoin trading/investing is dead? Far from it. The ease with which newcomers can now interact with smart contracts compared with what I had to do starting out is night-and-day. This, combined with distribution and increasingly useful apps means a new wave of capital flowing into crypto over the coming years. 

 Exciting, But There Remains Work To Be Done 

 The improvement we have here in UX cannot be overstated. I say this because I have myself onboarded non-crypto friends through TON's Wallet. Prior to Telegram’s current infrastructure, I would let out a small sigh at the prospect of trying to teach a friend how to use crypto. Now, thanks to Telegram, I do not see how it could be easier. 

 So that’s it, Telegram and TON have won, right? Not quite. The improvement in UX and distribution is a big leap forward, but we have yet to see a comprehensive range of consumer-facing apps. Mini apps are being developed and there is a major incentive for game devs to build a fun Telegram game that captures the attention of its huge user base. Alas, what exists now is more meme-based than utility-based. Regulations also remain a concern, but that is an ongoing industry-wide issue not isolated to Telegram or TON. 

 Telegram and TON have a lot to do, but I believe they will pull it off. The market seems to be pricing this in now, as $TON has already reached the top-10 crypto list in market cap. $TON’s run has largely been fueled by fervent speculation we are so familiar with, but there are real fundamentals to back up a lot of its growth. 

 Most of us want to see a future where crypto is being used by the masses. This sentiment is shared by Telegram’s co-founder and CEO Pavel Durov, who is a major Bitcoin advocate. TON’s mission statement is to “put crypto in every pocket.” Simply put, Telegram is better positioned to make that happen than any other entity in our growing industry.

u_today:555f7ac01094b:0,"Major US Exchange Kraken Gets Funds Back After ""Extortion"" Attempt","Thu, 20 Jun 2024 14:01:14 GMT",U.Today,"According to Nick Percoco, Kraken's chief security officer, the exchange has managed to return its funds following what it described as an ""extortion"" attempt. It has lost only a small amount of money to fees.  

 As reported by U.Today, a security researcher from an undisclosed firm notified the exchange about a critical bug that made it possible to effectively print money out of this air by receiving funds without completing deposits.  

 Instead of submitting a bug report, the researcher initially informed two other individuals about the vulnerability, which resulted in Kraken losing $3 million from its treasury.  

 The researchers refused to return the funds and started demanding a call with the firm's sales representatives. Kraken accused the firm of extortion and contacted law enforcement.  

 In another twist, well-known blockchain security firm CertiK revealed that it was responsible for discovering the bug. It claimed that Kraken had started demanding a mismatched amount of funds while threatening its employees. CertikK added that the multi-million withdrawals were actually part of its testing. ""The real question should be why Kraken’s in-depth defense system failed to detect so many test transactions,"" the firm said.  

 In his original X thread, Percoco claimed that Kraken never had an issue with ""legitimate"" researchers.  

 CertiK later clarified that it did not actually participate in Kraken's bounty program and was not seeking a reward. Moreover, it insists that the exchange was informed about the vulnerability in a timely fashion. However, the amount of funds that it has returned is different from the original sum that was requested by Kraken.  

 This is not the first time that CertiK has become a source of controversy. The firm would previously attract criticism and mockery after multiple projects that passed its audits ended up being hacked.

cointelegraph:08f388cfe094b:0,1inch partners with Blockaid to combat DeFi fraud and cyber threats,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 14:00:00 GMT",Cointelegraph,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform 1inch announced a collaboration with Web3 security provider Blockaid to upgrade security measures within its ecosystem.  

 On June 20, 1inch Network revealed its aim of identifying and preventing fraudulent activities like phishing scams and hacks. In an announcement, the DeFi platform highlighted that Blockaid’s security features, which simulate transactions before execution, will play an integral role in enhancing DeFi security.  

 The announcement highlighted the urgent need for security enhancements in the DeFi space. Citing the millions in crypto assets lost from malicious attacks in April 2024, the two companies argued that Blockaid’s security measures could help combat the rising tide of fraud and cyber threats. 

 Integrating real-time security alerts 

 1inch has introduced the 1inch Shield, a security solution developed in collaboration with Blockaid. This system detects and marks scam tokens, helping users avoid fraudulent transactions.  

 Integrating these features into the 1inch and broader DeFi ecosystem would provide real-time warnings about potential security risks. It supports major blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Base, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism and Avalanche. 

 Blockaid co-founder Ido Ben-Natan emphasized the significance of this collaboration and argued that the partnership with 1inch is a pivotal step in securing the Web3 ecosystem. He said:  

 The Shield application programming interface (API), which will be gradually integrated into 1inch products, is designed to be adaptable for any Web3 application, including decentralized applications (DApps), wallets and exchanges.

 Securing the DeFi ecosystem 

 Sergej Kunz, co-founder of 1inch, told Cointelegraph that the partnership also aims to help the broader DeFi ecosystem. Kunz clarified that it had launched its own product and provided access to it through an API. He said:  

 The executive believes that merging the strengths of leading providers will set a new standard for Web3 security.  

 “This collaboration sets a new standard for Web3 security by taking advantage of Blockaid’s strengths and combining it with additional AML compliance screening and labeling functionalities from other top vendors,” Ben-Natan added.  

 The Blockaid CEO said this approach ensures that Web3 users are protected from various threats, from scams and malicious attacks to compliance risks.

beincrypto:1f4f1bdc7094b:0,"BlackRock, Fidelity, JPMorgan Dominate Real-World Assets Tokenization Trend","Thu, 20 Jun 2024 18:22:02 GMT",Beincrypto,"The tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) has seen a surge in interest, with financial giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and JPMorgan taking the lead. 

 This trend signals a significant shift in the financial industry, showcasing the growing adoption of blockchain technology to enhance efficiency and accessibility in capital markets. 

 BlackRock, Fidelity, JPMorgan Tokenizing Real-World Assets 

 Fidelity International’s recent announcement of joining JPMorgan’s tokenized network marks a significant milestone. As per Kaiko analysts, this move positions Fidelity alongside other major players in the tokenization sector. This collaboration highlights the increasing interest in leveraging blockchain for real-world applications. 

 BlackRock’s BUIDL, a tokenized liquidity fund, exemplifies this trend. Launched in March, BUIDL has amassed over $460 million, surpassing several crypto-native firms like Maple Finance. Despite Maple’s recovery from the 2022 crypto lending collapse, its Cash Management Fund lags with around $16 million in assets, highlighting BUIDL’s success. 

 “Since its launch in March, BlackRock’s BUIDL has outpaced several crypto-native firms, including Maple Finance’s Cash Management Fund, which focuses on short-term cash instruments,” Kaiko analysts wrote. 

 The appeal of blockchain technology lies in its potential to transform capital markets. Maredith Hannon, Head of Business Development at WisdomTree, emphasizes this, noting that blockchain can address infrastructural challenges and unlock new investment opportunities. The technology’s ability to streamline workflows and improve settlement times is particularly compelling. 

 Central to this transformation are smart contracts, which automate transactions by executing predefined conditions without intermediaries. These self-executing contracts ensure transparency and efficiency, recording actions on a blockchain. For instance, in securities lending, smart contracts can automate operations, reduce errors, and create standardized identity credentials. 

 “Smart contracts offer opportunities to streamline and systematize many transactions that are multi-step or manual in today’s traditional financial markets. They can be used for sharing of identity and use credentials across financial firms, to eliminate counterparty risk and to validate whether an investor can hold a specific private equity fund based on their location or investor status,” Hannon wrote. 

 Collaborations, such as those between Citi, Wellington, and DTCC Digital Assets on the Avalanche Spruce Subnet, demonstrate the practical applications of smart contracts. These initiatives showcase how tokenization can enhance operational efficiency and reduce counterparty risk. 

 However, transitioning to digital infrastructure involves challenges. Legal considerations, identity standards, and data privacy require careful evaluation in collaboration with regulators. The financial services industry must work together to build an identity infrastructure that supports broader tokenization adoption while ensuring security and compliance.

beincrypto:adb6706da094b:0,Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Price Rise Halts as Market Cap Nears,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 18:00:00 GMT",Beincrypto,"Ethereum Name Service (ENS) price has painted a red candlestick on the daily chart while attempting to close above $26. 

 The profits the investors accumulate seem to be saturating the market, creating unfavorable conditions. 

 Ethereum Name Service Reception Weakens 

 Over the past ten days, the ENS price registered a massive rally, which resulted in the total supply in profit crossing 90%. This marked a market top for ENS. A market top is the highest point in a market cycle before a significant downturn begins. It represents the peak of asset prices before they start to decline. 

 Generally, this market top is formed when the total supply of profit of an asset crosses 95%. However, in the case of this altcoin, this threshold has been observed at 90%. Historically, every instance of this threshold being breached has been followed by correction. 

 The same could occur this time around as about 92% of all ENS is profitable currently. 

 As a consequence of this saturation, the possibility of profits that lay with the investors is about to be lost as well. According to the Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) indicator, close to 5.56 million ENS worth $144 million will remain at a loss. 

 This supply bought between $24.9 and $28.8 could have become profitable; however, the market’s top decline led to investors losing this shot. 

 ENS Price Prediction: Decline Seems Likely  

 ENS’s price at $24.8 fell below the support at $26.0 after failing to secure support for the third time this year. Given the last attempt failed, the altcoin slipped to $19.2; it would not be surprising to see the same this time. 

 The chances of falling to $23 and losing this support to $20.9 are high. Should the investors move to secure their profits, they could begin selling. This would lead to further decline, sending the altcoin to $19.2 again. 

 However, a bounce back from either of the support levels could try to breach and secure $26.0 as support. If this is successful, the bearish thesis would be invalidated, giving room to profits.

 India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has imposed a $2.2 million fine against Binance — the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume — for running afoul of the country’s anti-money laundering rules. 

 Binance Fined By India 

 Binance has been slapped with a $2.2 million (18.82 crore INR) fine for offering services to Indian customers without adhering to the nation’s anti-money laundering (AML) rules, according to a June 20 announcement. 

 In particular, the Financial Intelligence Unit found that Binance did not adhere to multiple Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) regulations, including reporting transaction records, complying with reporting requirements for suspicious activities, and enforcing robust measures to deter money laundering. 

 As a Virtual Digital Asset Service Provider, Binance qualifies as a reporting entity (RE) under Section 2 (as) (vi) of the PMLA, which necessitates the keeping and reporting of transaction records and the implementation of strict AML measures. 

 Since Binance reportedly failed to meet these requirements, Indian authorities issued show-cause notices to the firm and several other offshore cryptocurrency exchanges in January of this year, causing them to exit the Indian market for “operating illegally”.  

 But last month, Binance became the first overseas crypto-focused entity, along with KuCoin, to secure conditional approval from India’s FIU. This approval was granted on the condition that Binance would agree to pay a fine after a hearing with the financial agency. 

 Global Regulatory Woes 

 The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) announced in May that it was fining Binance $4.4 million for failing to register and report huge cryptocurrency transactions. The regulator claimed that Binance failed to register as a foreign money services business and report digital asset transactions surpassing $10,000. 

 However, the global cryptocurrency exchange has contested the administrative monetary penalty and allegations of noncompliance with AML and Countering the Financing of Terrorism regulations. 

 Meanwhile, Binance’s American subsidiary, Binance.US, is facing growing regulatory scrutiny from state authorities in the United States. Multiple states, including North Dakota, North Carolina, Alaska, Florida, Maine, and Oregon, have either canceled or refused to renew the exchange’s money transmitter licenses. This threatens to fumble Binance.US’s standing in the lucrative US market and paints a gloomy picture for the exchange’s future.

 ""When we came into this year, the executive branch has been, via the SEC, strongly negative to cryptocurrencies,"" Ripley said in the interview with CNBC ""Squawk Box"" host Joe Kernan. ""But, there have been many supporters throughout the U.S. government. I visit D.C. periodically and met with many people in Congress, the Senate, and there are a number of supporters there. And I think over the past several, I don't know, maybe two months or so, we've seen kind of strong support — and now bipartisan support as well."" 

 Ripley nodded toward the passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21. The bill aims to regulate the cryptocurrency industry comprehensively, passing 279-136 on May 22. 

 ""We didn't expect it to be that successful,"" Ripley added regarding the bill's overwhelming passage. ""It was really successful. I think it was 71 from the Democrat side as well. So, you know, we've kind have seen a little bit of softening up on the executive branch."" 

 Trump's 'recent' crypto journey 

 Ripley also noted former United States President Donald Trump's pivot toward crypto, which aligns the new position with a potential educational ""journey"" taken by the presumptive GOP nominee.  

 ""Everyone goes on a journey with bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I did myself. And you know his comments on bitcoin and cryptocurrency are recent, so I would hope that he's kind of on that learning journey,"" Ripley said in the interview. ""When individuals actually take the time to learn about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, it's almost always a positive outcome."" 

 Trump, who previously called Bitcoin a ""scam,"" released an NFT collection in April 2023 and even claimed support for crypto in late May of this year, the Block previously reported.

newsbtc:0667cc506094b:0,"Bitcoin Miners’ Reserves Deplete Amidst High OTC Selling, What This Means","Thu, 20 Jun 2024 20:00:32 GMT",NewsBTC,"Recent data from CryptoQuant has highlighted a significant shift in Bitcoin Miners behavior, with miner reserves dropping to their lowest levels since 2010 while over-the-counter (OTC) selling activity has surged to higher levels. 

 What This Means For BTC 

 At the beginning of the year, miner reserves stood at approximately 1.87 million BTC but have yet to grow to about 1.81 million BTC today, a level not seen since 2010. This reserve decline is notable as it indicates a higher propensity for miners to sell off their holdings. 

 Typically, this could lead to increased market supply and potential price depreciation, but the scenario has unfolded differently this year. 

 Despite the drop in miner-held BTC, the value of these reserves remains high, buoyed by a nearly 150% price increase since October last year, keeping the total dollar value of miner holdings near all-time highs at over $130 billion. 

 Additionally, data from CryptoQuant indicates that Bitcoin miners’ over-the-counter (OTC) sales have peaked daily since March. 

 Bitcoin In The Spotlight 

 This miner activity comes amid broader market movements that have seen significant price fluctuations. BTC’s price has retreated by nearly 7% in the past day, dropping from a peak of $66,436 to around $65,269. 

 The decrease aligns with a general volatility trend that has recently characterized the crypto market. Analyst Willy Woo commented on the situation, indicating that BTC might not see new highs until the current phase of miner capitulation and market boredom resolves, which historically precedes a significant rally. 

 I know it sucks, but BTC is not going to break all time highs until more pain and boredom plays out. 

 On the bright side, miners are capitulating and when that is through, it nearly always ends in a huge rally.

u_today:4ffd7d42c094b:0,Can Ripple Still Lose to SEC? Top Lawyer Weighs In,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 19:48:22 GMT",U.Today,"Jeremy Hogan, partner at Hogan & Hogan, has predicted that there will be no ""final glorious victory"" for the US Securities and Exchange Commission in the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  

 The SEC's attempts to appeal the case might potentially lead to disastrous outcomes for the agency, according to Hogan.  

 Even if the regulator somehow manages to win the appeal, the case would still come back down to the trial court since there would be a need for further factual determination.  

 In a significant blow to the SEC, Judge Analisa Torres determined that the XRP token was not a security when sold to retail investors on exchanges in July 2023. However, Torres also ruled that Ripple did violate federal securities laws with its XRP sales to institutional investors.  

 Last month, former SEC Division Chief Kristina Littman opined that the SEC might let the Ripple ruling just ""stay there"" as a district court opinion without potentially elevating it to a circuit level.  

 As reported by U.Today, the Ripple ruling was explicitly rejected by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who presided over the SEC's case against Terraform Labs. Judge Rakoff claimed that the legal status of a token should not be determined based on whether it was to institutional or retail investors. This logic was also adopted in the Coinbase decision in a win for the SEC.  

 Hence, it remains to be seen whether the SEC will still choose to appeal the case and elevate the Torres ruling despite scoring several wins. For now, the case remains in the remedies phase, with Ripple attempting to substantially reduce fines and penalties.  

 Last July, Gensler hinted that the SEC could end up appealing the Torres ruling. ""We're still looking at it and assessing,"" he said back then.

cointelegraph:c6a4baba4094b:0,Ethereum options data highlights bears’ plan to keep ETH price under $3.6K,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 19:41:00 GMT",Cointelegraph,"Ether's ETHUSD recent consolidation around $3,500 has significantly diminished the markets’ expectation for a monthly options expiry above $4,000. Bulls were initially optimistic, fueled by the potential approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by regulators, which led to a 23% gain on May 20. However, since then, the price of Ether has failed to maintain levels above $3,600. 

 A total of $3.5 billion in monthly ETH options is scheduled to expire on June 28 at Deribit, the leading exchange, followed by $286 million at OKX, and $142 million at Binance. Nevertheless, as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to review the S-1 filings from ETF providers, the likelihood of bullish bets surpassing $4,000 remains low. 

 Bears were not expecting Ether to surpass $3,000 

 Ether bulls did not anticipate the delay between the regulatory approval of the spot ETF and its actual trading commencement, confirmed by SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The exact timing remains uncertain within the upcoming three months. Due to this lack of momentum, the optimistic bets for the June 28 options expiry are unlikely to yield returns. 

 Simultaneously, Ether bears were surprised after a major regulatory concern for investors was addressed on June 19 when the SEC concluded its investigation into whether Ether could be classified as a security, as stated in a letter to Consensys. This decision means Consensys is no longer under scrutiny for potential ETH sales. 

 The open interest for Deribit's June 28 monthly options expiry stands at $3.5 billion. However, the actual outcome is expected to be lower, as prices above $4,000 and below $3,000 are currently seen as unrealistic.Cointelegraph 

 The 0.62 put-to-call ratio indicates an imbalance between the $2.2 billion call (buy) open interest and the $1.3 billion put (sell) options. Nevertheless, if Ether's price stays around $3,500 at 8:00 am UTC on June 28, only $257 million worth of these put options will be relevant. This discrepancy occurs because the right to sell Ether at $3,300 or $3,400 becomes irrelevant if ETH trades above these levels at expiry. 

 Bulls target $3,800 for a $500 million gain 

 Below are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price trends. The availability of options contracts for calls and puts on June 28 varies depending on the settlement price. The balance of potential gains for each side is outlined as follows:

 This rough calculation assumes that call options are used primarily for bullish bets and put options for neutral-to-bearish positions. However, this simplification does not account for more intricate investment strategies. 

 Unless there is an unexpected approval of a spot ETF before June 28, the likelihood supports a balanced result around $3,500. This should be viewed as a victory for the bears, especially considering that Ether was trading above $3,800 just two weeks prior.

cointelegraph:f00a4a75c094b:0,Judge in SEC v. Kraken case suggests he will deny motion to dismiss,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 22:10:00 GMT",Cointelegraph,"Lawyers representing Kraken and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) presented competing arguments to a federal judge over whether digital assets on the exchange may be considered securities. 

 In a June 20 hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Payward — the firm doing business as Kraken — lawyer Matthew Solomon and SEC counsel Peter Moores met before Judge William Orrick to address a motion to dismiss filed by the exchange in February. The judge suggested he was “inclined to deny” the motion to dismiss, saying it was “plausible” digital assets were offered and sold as investment contracts on the crypto exchange. 

 In arguments before the judge, Solomon argued that there were significant differences in litigated cases between the SEC and Terraform Labs and Telegram. He also cited Judge Analisa Torres’ decision in the SEC’s case against Ripple Labs — in which the judge ruled the XRPUSD token was a security when sold to institutional investors — but suggested the closest comparable case to Kraken’s was Coinbase’s.  

 The SEC’s argument focused on treating Kraken as an “ecosystem” in which tokens are sold as investment contracts — or “concepts,” as the commission alleged — which would seemingly make them securities under the Howey test. The exchange’s legal team pushed back against these legal theories. 

 “I think conjuring up the notion of an ecosystem just for crypto — that’s not the way rules oughta be applied,” said Solomon. “Crypto deserves no better than anybody else, but they oughta have the rules applied equally to them as they’ve applied to everyone else.” 

 The Kraken lawyer added: 

 Judge Orrick did not issue a ruling on the motion to dismiss at the hearing but suggested that after arguments from Kraken and the SEC, he was still leaning toward denying it. In addition, he said, “a year should be sufficient” for discovery if the case moves forward.

newsbtc:6929b6e3c094b:0,"Bitcoin Crash Below $66,000 Stuns Market, Why A Drop To $54,930 Is Possible","Thu, 20 Jun 2024 22:00:54 GMT",NewsBTC,"The Bitcoin price crash below $66,000 has taken the market by surprise, leading to over $90 million in liquidations in a 24-hour period. But even after dropping so much already, analysts do not believe that the worst is over. In particular, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has said that Bitcoin may still have a ways to go before the crash is over, prediction another 20% decline from here. 

 Bitcoin Falls Below Major Pricing Band 

 Crypto analyst Ali Martinez posted a new analysis on X (formerly Twitter) on the Bitcoin price that paints a rather bearish picture for the pioneer cryptocurrency. According to Martinez, the Bitcoin crash below $68,000 had actually pushed it below an important level. 

 The major level of importance here is the $67,890 pricing range, which the price has now fallen below. As Martinez explains, this area is important as the “+0.5σ MVRV pricing band” lies here. It also means that a crash below this level is very bearish for the price, and as Martinez shows, Bitcoin has already fallen below it. 

 This fall puts a bearish motion in place as the crypto analyst believes it may trigger a correction. Now, while corrections are normal, the expectation for how far the crash will go is what is worrying because the analyst has placed a possible $54,930 target for the price. 

 #Bitcoin has dropped below the +0.5σ MVRV pricing band at $67,890, which may trigger a correction toward the mean pricing band at $54,930. pic.twitter.com/zZvswgpUpS 

 Such a crash would mean that the Bitcoin price would fall another 20% from its current level. Given the previous crashes, this could be devastating for altcoins, whose prices could fall another 50% if BTC were to crash below $55,000. 

 Navigating The Drop In Interest 

 One interesting development for Bitcoin is the drop in interest that has been experienced this week. For example, the daily trading volume, according to CoinMarketCap, fell 43.5% in the last day along. This brings the Bitcoin daily trading volume to around $19 billion from the almost $40 billion recorded the previous day. 

 This drop in trading volume indicates that investors are taking fewer positions. With the uncertainty surrounding the market, this comes as no surprise, given that investors are prone to wait for the situation to improve before taking more positions. 

 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has also declined, showing that fear is growing in the market. It is now sitting at a score of 60, which shows greed, a long way from May’s score of 76, which showed extreme greed in the market. 

 At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is holding at $65,667, with a 0.77% gain in the last day.

coindesk:84676693b094b:0,Winklevoss Twins Say They Each Gave $1 Million to Trump Presidential Campaign,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 21:56:32 GMT",CoinDesk,"Gemini CEO Tyler and his twin brother Cameron Winklevoss, the company's president, have made two of the first major presidential contributions from prominent crypto executives, favoring former President Donald Trump with $1 million each in support, Tyler explained Thursday in a extensive posting on X. 

 ""Over the past few years, the Biden Administration has openly declared war against crypto,"" Winklevoss began in the lengthy case against President Joe Biden's administration. ""It has weaponized multiple government agencies to bully, harass, and sue the good actors in our industry in an effort to destroy it."" 

 Gemini was targeted last year in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission case that accused the exchange of offering unregistered securities, which Tyler Winklevoss called at the time a ""manufactured parking ticket."" His explanation for supporting Trump was much more about opposing Biden. 

 ""President Donald J. Trump is the pro-Bitcoin, pro-crypto, and pro-business choice,"" he concluded. 

 Tyler Winklevoss said he used Trump's recently established willingness to take crypto contributions and gave his contribution in the form of 15.47 bitcoin, and his brother posted later that he'd done the same. The money goes to the Trump 47 Committee Inc., according to a spokeswoman. That's a ""joint fundraising committee"" which may divide the amount to comply with legal limits for campaign contributions, meaning the money could be spread across a longer list of Republican benefactors. 

 The brothers have – all along – donated matching amounts to U.S. election efforts. It was already a large sum that placed them among the major individual contributors in the 2024 campaigns. Before today, the two had given a total of about $2.7 million each, according to Federal Election Commission disclosures. On the presidential level, they'd already backed most of the prominent contenders that had tried earlier to yank the Republican nomination out from under Trump: Vivek Ramaswamy, Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Gov. Ron Desantis. 

 The bulk of their donations, however, have been to the industry's main political action committee (PAC), Fairshake. Their combined $5 million represents a small but significant share of the Fairshake super PAC contributions that have now almost reached $169 million. That money has been devoted to buying outside ads for congressional candidates in the hope of loading Congress with crypto supporters. 

 The Winklevoss donations to Trump 47 join similar maxed-out contributions from Jeffrey Sprecher, the founder, chairman, and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, and his wife Kelly Lynn Loeffler, a former U.S. senator and CEO of Bakkt; Joe Ricketts, the founder and former CEO of TD Ameritrade; and Robert Bigelow, who owns Budget Suites of America and founded the now-defunct Bigelow Aerospace.

coindesk:572b604f6094b:0,"California Judge Breaks With New York Counterpart, Sends Ripple Securities Lawsuit to Trial","Thu, 20 Jun 2024 21:28:04 GMT",CoinDesk,"A California judge has ruled that a civil securities lawsuit against Ripple will proceed to trial, denying in part the crypto firm’s motion for summary judgment in a suit alleging that Ripple’s CEO violated state securities laws in 2017. 

 A jury will hear arguments on whether Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse made “misleading statements” in connection with the sale of securities in a 2017 televised interview. The other four claims in the class action securities lawsuit – the so-called “failure to register claims” – were tossed out on Thursday by Judge Phyllis Hamilton of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. 

 “We are pleased that the California court dismissed all class action claims. The one individual state law claim that survived will be dealt with at trial,” said Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stu Alderoty in an emailed statement. 

 The plaintiff has alleged that Garlinghouse violated California’s securities laws by professing to be “very, very long XRP” while simultaneously selling “millions of XRP on various cryptocurrency exchanges” throughout 2017. 

 According to court documents, Ripple’s lawyers argued that the claim should be tossed because XRP doesn’t meet the definition of a security under the Howey Test and “thus cannot give rise to a claim for misleading statements in connection with a security.” 

 In her Thursday ruling, Hamilton said that Ripple’s lawyers urged her to “follow the reasoning” of U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres who, in a parallel case in the Southern District of New York (SDNY), ruled that XRP did not meet all the prongs of the Howey Test when sold directly to retail participants on crypto exchanges. 

 Torres’ ruling constituted a partial victory for Ripple, and was celebrated by many in the crypto industry as a step in the right direction for long-awaited regulatory clarity, as well as a potential precedent for other crypto securities cases. But Torres’ ruling hasn’t seemed to have as much sway as hopefuls once thought it might. Last year, Torres’ colleague in the SDNY, District Judge Jed Rakoff, rejected her ruling in a separate case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Singaporean crypto firm Terraform Labs. 

 Hamilton, in her Thursday ruling, also broke with Torres’ legal opinion that that XRP sold to “programmatic” (meaning non-institutional) traders was not a security because those traders had no expectation of profits due to the efforts of others, one of the four prongs of the Howey Test. 

 “The court declines to find as a matter of law that a reasonable investor would have derived any expectation of profit from general cryptocurrency market trends, as opposed to Ripple’s efforts to facilitate XRP’s use in cross-border payments, among other things,” Hamilton wrote. “Accordingly, the [court] cannot find as a matter of law that Ripple’s conduct would not have led a reasonable investor to have an expectation of profit due to the efforts of others.” 

 In his statement, Alderoty added that Torres’ ruling in the SEC case “still stands.” 

 “Nothing here disturbs that decision,” Alderoty wrote.

the_block:ecb5347ad094b:0,3iq applies to launch Solana ETP in Canada,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 21:27:59 GMT",The Block,"Investment firm 3iQ has applied to launch the first Solana exchange-traded product (ETP) in Canada. 

 The proposed ETP, called Solana Fund, would offer Canadian investors exposure to SOL without requiring them to use hot wallets or other blockchain-related technology, 3iQ said Thursday in a statement. The fund, if approved, would launch on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker QSOL. 

 “As pioneers in digital asset investment management, we look forward to continuing our mission to deliver regulated investment vehicles — embodying the highest standards and working with best-in-class partners — for individual and institutional investors to efficiently access the crypto asset class,” said Greg Benhaim, executive vice president of product and head of trading at 3iQ. 

 It's unclear when the Solana Fund, if approved, would become available to investors. 

 3iq did not immediately respond to The Block’s request for comment. 

 Canadian officials greenlighted spot bitcoin and ether ETFs such as Purpose Ether ETF and CI Galaxy Ethereum ETF in 2021. The precedent-setting approvals came a couple years before U.S. regulators first allowed similar crypto-based funds to operate in the U.S. 

 SOL, which launched in 2020, is the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at $61.8 billion, according to The Block's cryptocurrency price data.

the_block:59a3ce346094b:0,California judge casts doubt on dismissing SEC’s case against crypto exchange Kraken,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 21:03:52 GMT",The Block,"A district judge cast doubt on crypto exchange Kraken's move to dismiss claims brought against it by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 Judge William H. Orrick of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California told the courtroom on Thursday he was ""inclined to deny"" a motion to dismiss a lawsuit between the two. 

 ""I think it's plausible that the crypto assets are offered and sold as investment contracts,"" Orrick said. 

 In November, the SEC sued Kraken’s parent firms, Payward and Payward Ventures, for allegedly operating an online trading platform. Kraken moved to dismiss the lawsuit in February. Since then, a group of eight U.S. state attorneys general filed an amicus brief arguing the SEC's lawsuit exceeded the agency's authority, while Kraken has filed multiple documents arguing the SEC has failed to satisfy elements of the Howey Test. 

 The Howey Test is based on a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court case frequently cited by the SEC, to determine if an asset qualifies as an investment contract and, therefore, a security. The SEC has pushed back against Kraken and has said the exchange is trying to dodge investor protections required by securities laws. The SEC has also argued that a written agreement is not needed for there to be an investment contract. 

 Kraken has its ""work cut out"" for them, Judge Orrick said on Thursday. 

 Comparisons to Coinbase 

 The SEC's case against Coinbase was also brought up frequently on Thursday. There, Judge Katherine Polk Failla decided not to dismiss the agency's case against the exchange. In that case, the SEC ""plausibly"" alleged that some crypto transactions on Coinbase's platform were investment contracts, Judge Failla said in March. 

 ""Naturally this court will look to that case and its reasoning in trying to determine whether you should follow the reasoning of Judge Failla in that case,"" Matthew Soloman, who is representing Kraken, said in court. ""We don't think you should."" 

 Coinbase was not decided correctly, Solomon said. For example, the court created a concept called an ecosystem, which Kraken interpreted to include issuers, the blockchain, promoters and others, Solomon said. Buyers and sellers were not included in Judge Failla's ecosystem term, he added. 

 ""Conjuring up the notion of an ecosystem just for crypto, that's not the way rules ought to be applied,"" Solomon later said. ""Crypto deserves no better than anybody else, but they ought to have the rules applied equally to them as they've applied to everyone else. In the Coinbase decision, I think here today, the rules are being stretched to the breaking point."" 

 Meanwhile, the SEC's lawyer, Peter Moores, said Coinbase was ""correctly decided."" 

 Moores also talked about how the Howey Test encompasses more than just an investment contract. Kraken has argued in its move to dismiss the case that there needs to be a written contract for an asset to be a security. 

 The Howey Test doesn't require a contract and it's about the ""substance of the matter,"" Moores later added. 

 ""If you're only looking at the form, you're only looking at the skeleton, you're not actually looking at the flesh that surrounds it and the flesh is really what matters. It is what gives the life to the actual investment opportunity here,"" Moores said. 

 Major questions  

 Kraken's lawyers previously applied the major questions doctrine in its filings asking the judge to dismiss the case.  The doctrine, which has been often cited by crypto firms, says if an agency wants to decide on an issue that has major national significance, it has to be supported by clear congressional authorization. The SEC has asserted that it is not ""assuming new powers."" 

 ""I don't think this is a major question,"" Orrick said. ""It's not a significant expansion of regulatory authority."" 

 Orrick said later in the hearing he would not change his mind on the major questions doctrine. 

 Toward the end of the hearing, Judge Orrick directed Kraken and the SEC to provide disclosures and said discovery should take about a year.

newsbtc:281300893094b:0,"Bitcoin Analyst Claims BTC Consolidation Will Continue, Hedge Funds Throw In The Towel","Thu, 20 Jun 2024 21:00:00 GMT",NewsBTC,"Bitcoin is trending lower at spot rates, sliding away from all-time highs. Looking at the performance in the daily chart, it looks like bears are stepping up, following the general inactivity in an overwhelmingly bearish trend. When writing, the coin is down 10% from March 2024 highs but steady. 

 Will Bitcoin Consolidate For Two More Months? 

 Taking to X, one analyst argued that the current state of affairs will likely continue in the days ahead. While most experts predicted Bitcoin prices to rebound sharply, even breaching all-time highs and race to $100,000 after the all-important Halving event on April 20, bears have had the upper hand. 

 So far, the coin is stuck in a broad horizontal range with caps at around $74,000 on the upper end and $56,500, registered in May. Technically, the uptrend remains from a top-down preview following the welcomed push higher in Q1 2024.  

 However, even as traders expect more gains in the days ahead, the analyst said prices will likely stagnate in the next few trading weeks. www.tradingview.com/x/QzSvNtFN 

 When the network halved network rewards in 2020, the analyst notes that the coin moved sideways for 150 days, with prices capped between $9,000 and $11,000. Currently, the sideways consolidation, the analyst added, has been for 90 days, nearly halfway through the last cycle. 

 If this guides, prices could continue moving sideways for the next two months, even dumping below the key support levels.  

 Thus far, Bitcoin bear bars are banding along the lower BB, pointing to intense selling momentum. At the same time, the divergence between the middle and lower BB points to rising volatility, swinging in favor of sellers. 

 Crypto Hedge Funds Reducing BTC Exposure As Whales Sell Via OTC 

 Currently, macroeconomic factors and on-chain data paint a cause for concern. One analyst observed that more crypto hedge funds have reduced their BTC exposure, indicating a loss of confidence.  

 Over the past 20 trading days, the analyst claims that crypto hedge funds have slashed their Bitcoin market exposure to 0.37, the lowest level since October 2020. 

 While crypto hedge funds reduce exposure, another analyst said inflow to over-the-counter (OTC) desks has risen since Halving.  

 This suggests that miners or big institutions are offloading BTC away from exchanges. On-chain data shows that OTC balances rose by 62,000 BTC, one of the largest 30-day recorded changes since 2017.

cointelegraph:2c58d297f094b:0,HectorDAO files for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the US,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 20:44:19 GMT",Cointelegraph,"HectorDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the United States following a series of market collapses and hacks that drained the community of funds. 

 According to the June 17 filing from Interpath Advisory, a court-appointed firm specializing in bankruptcy stewardship and reorganization, HectorDAO’s current financial condition is mainly due to three factors: the collapse of the Terra network in May 2022, the collapse of the Multichain protocol, and a hack impacting the Hector treasury. 

 In the filing, Interpath Advisory noted that it was still investigating whether the January 16 hack, which resulted in $2.7 million in funds being drained from HectorDAO, was an inside job committed by former managers of the DAO’s treasury.Cointelegraph 

 HectorDAO's troubled history 

 The decentralized community’s troubles began in 2022 with the collapse of Terra’s ecosystem, which inflicted a hefty $16.4 million loss on HectorDAO’s treasury assets. Despite the setback, members of HectorDAO continued normal operations for over a year, until July 17, 2023. 

 On July 15, 2023, the HectorDAO community members faced a choice: migrate the decentralized organization to a different blockchain and rebrand the project or liquidate all assets and shutter the organization. Two days later, 83% of DAO members voted to liquidate the DAO as per the HIP-42 vote. 

 Related: Julian Assange’s brother denies AssangeDAO soft rug claims: ‘It’s just false!’ 

 Immediately following the vote, the decentralized community’s governing body established a committee to handle the liquidation and distribution of the remaining assets.  

 However, as the assets were set to be distributed among investors, HectorDAO suffered a $2.7 million exploit. Members of the decentralized organization alleged that following the Jan. 16 incident, contact with the liquidation committee could not be established. 

 This led to the DAO members accusing the management team of gross negligence and potential involvement in the hack. Ultimately, the Hector community demanded that control of the remaining funds be entrusted to a neutral party — Interpath Advisory. 

 What is Chapter 15? 

 Chapter 15 bankruptcy filings allow foreign entities or entities with investors across international jurisdictions to file for bankruptcy proceedings in the United States court system. 

 The Chapter 15 filing does not, in and of itself, reorganize the holdings of an entity or restructure debt — it merely gives corporate entities, organizations, and the investors involved an avenue to settle these matters in U.S. courts.

 Martin Shkreli, also known as “Pharma Bro,” is now claiming Donald Trump’s 18-year-old son, Barron Trump, launched the TrumpCoin (DJT) token with his father’s approval and holds the private keys to its smart contract address. 

 Shkreli, who spent more than six years in prison for securities fraud, claims Barron Trump approached him to launch the Solana-based token in April — now worth $146 million, according to Birdseye data.

 Barron Trump and his representatives have not issued a public statement on the matter. 

 In a Mario Nawfal-hosted X Spaces, Shkreli claimed he only assisted his “friend” Barron Trump with advice about the token launch but didn’t have an active hand in deploying the token itself. 

 Instead, he alleged Barron Trump was the true creator of DJT, adding that cryptocurrency influencer “Ansem” was also involved. 

 “I taught someone how to make a contact, and they pushed the button, not me. Keys are with Trump, not me,” Shkreli said in an X post. In an X Spaces on Tuesday, Shkreli suggested 10 people were involved in the token launch.

"tag:reuters.com,2024:newsml_L4N3II1I5:0",Winklevoss twins donate $2 million in bitcoin to support Trump,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 20:16:39 GMT",Reuters,"    The billionaire Winklevoss twins, founders of cryptocurrency company Gemini, said on Thursday they had each donated $1 million in bitcoin to support Donald Trump, the latest crypto executives to get behind the Republican presidential candidate.  

 Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, whose crypto firm in February entered settlement agreements with U.S. and New York state financial regulators after accusations of wrongdoing, announced the donations in posts on social media site X. 

 They did not specify where the donations were sent. 

 Tyler Winklevoss posted that President Joe Biden's Democratic administration had ""openly declared war on crypto"" and that Trump was ""pro-Bitcoin, pro-crypto, and pro-business."" 

 Trump has presented himself as a champion for crypto, including at a San Francisco fundraiser this month with tech executives during which he slammed Democrats' attempts to regulate the crypto sector. 

 The crypto industry is increasingly trying to influence U.S. politicians as it faces heightened scrutiny from regulators, especially since bankruptcies at major crypto firms in 2022 spooked investors, exposed fraud and misconduct, and left millions of investors out of pocket. 

 In February, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) said Gemini would return at least $1.1 billion to customers of its beleaguered lending program due to a third party’s bankruptcy and pay a fine of $37 million for unsafe and unsound practices as part of a settlement with the regulator. 

 Gemini also settled a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it had engaged in alleged unsafe and unsound practices for $21 million in February, without admitting or denying wrongdoing in the agreement. 

 The Winklevoss twins shot to fame after they sued Facebook META and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg, alleging he had stolen their idea for the social networking site. They agreed to a settlement in 2008 in which they received cash and Facebook stock. 

 The Biden administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

cointelegraph:008639009094b:0,"Winklevoss twins pledge $2M for Trump, claiming Biden waged war on crypto","Thu, 20 Jun 2024 20:04:06 GMT",Cointelegraph,"Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have each pledged $1 million in Bitcoin BTCUSD toward the reelection of former U.S. President Donald Trump. 

 In June 20 X posts, the Winklevoss twins said they planned to vote for the prospective Republican Party candidate for U.S. President on Nov. 5, saying they would each send 15.47 BTC — roughly $1 million at the time of publication — to his campaign. Both brothers claimed that Trump was “pro-Bitcoin” and “pro-crypto,” and President Joe Biden had “openly declared war against crypto” while in office. 

 “President Donald J. Trump is the pro-Bitcoin, pro-crypto, and pro-business choice,” claimed Tyler. “This is not even remotely open for debate. Anyone who tells you otherwise is severely misinformed, delusional, or not telling the truth [...] It’s time for the crypto army to send a message to Washington. That attacking us is political suicide.”Cointelegraph 

 Tyler specifically cited the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement actions against crypto firms under the Biden administration and the “weaponization of the banking system against crypto companies” — a reference to Operation Choke Point 2.0. The twins did not mention the regulator’s activity under Trump from 2017 to 2021. 

 The Winklevoss brothers reportedly attended a June fundraiser for Trump, costing up to $300,000 per person. They have also donated roughly $5 million to the Fairshake political action committee and its affiliates, which has been responsible for attack ads against lawmakers and backing certain Democratic and Republican candidates for office.  

 The twins’ announcement did not mention Trump’s conviction on 34 felony counts in May, which could interfere with the former president’s attempt to run again. Though he leads the polls as the prospective Republican presidential candidate, Trump will face a sentencing hearing in New York on July 11 — less than a week before he is expected to secure the official party nomination. 

 In the last two months amid his legal troubles, Trump has hosted a dinner for people who purchased a non-fungible token of his mugshot in a criminal case in Georgia, said his campaign will accept donations in crypto and met with executives from major mining firms — the last of which resulted in Trump announcing his intention to have all BTC mined in the United States. President Biden has also reportedly been considering having his reelection campaign accept cryptocurrency. 

 Many on X seemed supportive of the Winklevoss’ endorsement. However, some questioned Trump’s intentions on crypto and whether he was looking to learn from the example of Robert F. Kennedy Jr, a crypto-friendly candidate running as an Independent in 2024. Trump also called Bitcoin a scam in 2021 after he had left office.

the_block:094e45fce094b:0,Martin Shkreli’s Trumpcoin involvement raises questions of securities fraud,"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 19:23:00 GMT",The Block,"Disgraced former pharma executive Martin Shkreli confirmed Wednesday he was involved in the creation of a Trump-branded meme coin called Trumpcoin in a 7-hour X Spaces event. Although Shkreli, who is out on parole after receiving a seven-year sentence in 2018 for securities fraud, claims his financial interests in the project were “nonexistent,” his involvement has raised questions regarding his potential legal culpability.  

 The Solana-based token, which trades under the ticker DJT, first came to light on Monday after Peter Thiel associate Mike Solana claimed that former President Trump endorsed the project, which was allegedly being spearheaded by his son Baron Trump. Rumors of these official ties caused the token to rally 385% within 24 hours, amassing over $360 million in cumulative trading volume. 

 That all came crashing down Wednesday after news began to leak that Martin Shkreli, who is best known for once jacking up the price of an HIV treatment by over 4,000%, was linked to the project. Shkreli, who initially denied involvement, later confirmed he was part of the “50-person” team that created the token, allegedly on behalf of Barron Trump. This revelation came only after on-chain sleuth ZachXBT responded to blockchain analysis firm Arhkam Research’s $150,000 bounty for information exposing who was behind the effort. 

 Many unanswered questions remain about the project, such as the extent of Barron or Donald Trump’s involvement, whether influencers like Andrew Tate and Ansem are backers, and Shkreli’s financial incentives. This is particularly difficult to determine, considering that most of the information has come from Shkreli, who is a notoriously unreliable source. DL News reported a Trump insider denied the campaign’s involvement.  

 Possible legal consequences for Shkreli  

 The Block reached out to several legal experts to get their views on the complicated situation. In short, Shkreli may face legal consequences if he either unwittingly committed securities fraud by launching an investment vehicle or lied about the Trump campaign’s endorsement of the project using the 45th president’s likeness — though it isn’t yet clear whether any crimes have actually been committed. 

 “The alleged fraud could be any number of things: misrepresenting Trump or Barron, claiming he wasn’t involved when actually being an advisor and/or the creator, lying about who was on the team, etc,” Columbia University Adjunct Assistant Professor of Business Austin Campbell told The Block in a direct message. 

 “If he lied about his involvement or Barron’s involvement and then flipped his story when publicly exposed, is that securities fraud … or just regular old fraud?” Campbell added. “Lying in commercial affairs need not involve securities to be a crime. Your microwave manufacturer can’t lie to you and tell you it doesn’t need electricity to run (unless that is true).” 

 MetaLeX creator and crypto legal expert Gabriel Shapiro echoed this point, saying that any securities law implications “depend on the communications and expectations,” or in other words, if there was a clear expectation of profit. It’s an open question whether attempting to monetize attention falls afoul of the law, though the recent trend of “celebrity” memecoins created by artists like Iggy Azalea and Caitlin Jenner “push it more toward potential securities law classification.” 

 Attorney and Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran was the first to point out that Shkreli, if his claims are true, is likely in violation of the terms of his parole. “Shkreli’s 3 year parole terms require him to give full financial statements, and to avoid ‘any self-employment involving access to client money or investments’ (as well as avoiding other crimes),” Cochran posted on social media site X on June 18. 

 After being convicted of securities fraud and misleading investors about the performance of his hedge funds, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, Shkreli was granted an early release from federal prison in May 2022 due to good conduct while incarcerated.  

 However, it isn’t yet clear whether Shkreli has committed any crimes this time around. Meme coins, a relatively new fad within the crypto industry, have not yet been subject to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement action, potentially granting market participants a degree of plausible deniability.  

 “The fact that he would be triggering limitations on his activities post-release from prison is the least of the problems, in the sense that he'd be doing brand new securities fraud,” University of Kentucky law professor Brian Frye told The Block in an interview. Frye noted that Shkreli’s parole terms limit his involvement in securities markets, and ability to manage other people’s money as well as require extensive financial disclosures.  

 Frye added Shkreli’s situation is complicated by the unknown circumstances of the token’s creation. For instance, it isn’t clear whether Shkreli, who claims he would receive a percentage of Barron’s returns rather than profit from the DJT token directly, bought in and plans to sell.  

 Both Frye and Enclave Markets’s general counsel Olta Andoni, however, are skeptical of any Trump-family endorsement. “I would doubt the Trump campaign would like to be associated with someone like him,” Andoni said in an email. She added that if Shkreli is indeed running this investment scheme for the financial benefit of Barron “we should welcome the SEC with open arms.” 

 “But with Martin Shkreli, I guess you just never know,” Frye said.  

 In the past, Trump did not hide his contempt for Shkreli. On the campaign trail in 2015, Trump said Shkreli looked like “a spoiled brat” and said, “That guy is nothing. He's zero. He's nothing. He ought to be ashamed of himself,” according to Business Insider. Nonetheless, Shkreli endorsed Trump for president several months later.  

 Implications for Trump? 

 Many have noted that this situation, now garnering wider media coverage, may also have political or legal implications for the Republican presidential candidate.  

 “While the argument that memecoins like DJT are securities is weak, the [Security and Exchange Commission] enforcement staff might find this scenario too irresistible to pass up. I wouldn’t be shocked if they opened up an informal investigation just to ask some questions and score political points in the process,” James ""MetaLawMan"" Murphy told The Block in a direct message.  

 No one from the campaign has confirmed its involvement in the project, and Shkreli himself only claims to have overheard Barron discussing Trumpcoin with his father over the phone.  

 “The question is: Can the SEC really decide to come down like a hammer on Trump for this, even though they haven't really done anything with respect to a ton of other people who are doing essentially, if not identically, the same thing?” Frye said, adding that an enforcement action would be a “fraught decision” even if “everyone seems to want to have something” on Trump.  

 Ajit Tripathi of Polygon noted that Shkreli allegedly encouraged Barron away from discussing the token launch with lawyers. He added that Shkreli seems to think “there are no consequences,” which is largely the case in crypto, considering how few pump and dumps and scams are actually prosecuted. “That's the trouble with unregulated financial markets, they attract greed and all kinds of characters.” 

 “He's a known fraudster. He seems to think of himself as a fraud artist,” Tripathi said. “He talked about his prison experience with no guilt or compunction as if it were an interesting experience.” 

 The question is whether the man Trump called a “spoiled brat” is heading there again.

cointelegraph:6e311b8fa094b:0,Why is Bitcoin price down today?,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 13:22:24 GMT",Cointelegraph,"On June 21, Bitcoin BTCUSD experienced a 2.30% drop, reaching $63,500, its lowest level in over a month. This decline was linked to a series of outflows from Bitcoin's spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and a noticeable decrease in BTC market dominance as altcoins gained traction.Cointelegraph 

 Spot Bitcoin ETFs outflows resume 

 Bitcoin's price decline today follows days of outflows from its U.S.-based spot ETFs. Notably, these investment vehicles have witnessed nearly $500 million in withdrawals since June 10.Cointelegraph 

 These ETF outflows coincide with a rise in U.S. dollar’s strength versus a basket of top foreign currencies, signaling a growing risk-off mood among investors. This follows mixed macroeconomic data from the U.S. and the Fed lowering its likelihood of rate cuts from four to just one in 2024.Cointelegraph 

 A higher interest rate scenario reduces the opportunity cost of holding riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, a sentiment that has burdened Bitcoin prices down in recent days, including today. 

 Bitcoin’s market dominance slides 

 Bitcoin's losses today further coincides with its declining share in the crypto market. 

 Notably, the Bitcoin Dominance Index (BTC.D), which measures BTC's market capitalization versus the rest of the crypto market, dropped 0.55% to 55.14% on June 21, continuing its decline from the local top of 56.29% established three days ago. Cointelegraph 

 In other words, most investors have rotated their capital out of the Bitcoin market to seek opportunities in altcoins, particularly in the wake of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) decision to end its investigation into Ethereum, the leading altcoin by market capitalization. 

 These trends are further visible among institutional investors, with the CoinShares weekly report showing investors withdrawing capital from Bitcoin-based investment funds but increasing their exposure to altcoins, particularly Ether ETHUSD. 

 ""The outflows were entirely focussed on Bitcoin, seeing US$621 million outflows, the bearishness also prompted US$1.8 million inflows into short-bitcoin,"" CoinShares wrote.Cointelegraph 

 BTC price: technical correction? 

 Bitcoin's losses today is part of a broader correction occurring inside its prevailing bull flag pattern. 

 Bull flags are bullish continuation pattern characterized by two downward-sloping, parallel trendlines after a strong upside move. As a rule of technical analysis, the pattern resolves after the price breaks above the upper trendline and rises by as much as the height of the previous upside move. 

 Related: 6 months of sideways? Bitcoin price action mimics 2023 lull 

 As of June 21, BTC's price was pulling back after testing the upper trendline of its bull flag pattern, eyeing a further drop toward the lower trendline below $60,000, which it may hit by June's end.Cointelegraph 

 Nonetheless, Bitcoin's overall bias is skewed to the upside, eyeing a breakout above the flag's upper trendline at around $72,000 if the technical pattern plays out as intended. Should it happen, BTC's bull flag target will be around $88,000 by July or August.

beincrypto:6c61eb54a094b:0,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Metrics Squeeze Price, Leaving No Breathing Space","Fri, 21 Jun 2024 13:15:00 GMT",Beincrypto,"Some months ago, Shiba Inu SHIBUSD was part of the prestigious top 10 cryptocurrencies in market capitalization. Fast forward to this day, the token has dropped two places below the number.  

 On-chain analysis offers insights into the potential of the memecoin. As of this writing, SHIB’s price changes hands at $0.000018. 

 Market Cap and Activity Fall by Staggering Numbers 

 Shiba Inu’s price is not the only metric that experienced a notable downturn. According to CoinGecko, the market cap is now a shadow of its former self. 

 Market cap, a short form for market capitalization, is the product of price and circulating supply. Therefore, for a token whose total supply is in circulation, an increase in price brings about an increase in market cap.  

 Also, when the market cap decreases, prices follow. In March, the market cap of SHIB was over $18 billion, according to CoinGecko. At press time, the same market cap holds at $10.64 billion, meaning the value has decreased by a mind-blowing $8 billion. 

 Apart from the market cap, activity on Shiba Inu’s network has been unimpressive, as shown by the active, news and zero-balance addresses 

 As the name implies, active addresses track the number of unique active users on the blockchain. However, new users indicate adoption as they measure the number of users making their first transaction on the network, similar to the zero-balance addresses. 

 Further, an overview of all three shows major declines within a seven-day window. For instance, new addresses have fallen by 15.45%. Zero-balance addresses dropped by 71.27%, while active addresses were no better, with a 45.39% decrease. 

 Should the overall network activity continue to decrease, SHIB’s price may not experience a significant respite. 

 Traders Prefer Short Positions 

 Furthermore, the Funding Rate remains negative after dropping on June 17. Specifically, SHIB’s Funding Rate is 0.008%. 

 The Funding Rate represents the difference between a cryptocurrency’s perpetual price and the index value. When it is positive, it means that traders are bullish on the price. It also means that the contract value is at a premium compared to the spot price. 

 Conversely, a negative reading implies that the contract price trades at a discount to the spot value. In Shiba Inu’s case, the negative ratio suggests that the broader trader sentiment is bearish. As such, it will be challenging for SHIB’s price to bounce off the current 28.50% 14-day decrease. 

 To predict SHIB’s next movement, BeInCrypto looks at the In/ Out of Money Around Prices (IOMAP) indicator. The IOMAP gives traders insights into potential prices to buy or sell based on holders’ current profits and losses. 

 SHIB Price Prediction: Is It Time to Buy the Dip? 

 A large cluster of addresses in the money can support the price. Also, a large cluster of addresses out of the money will be a resistance point. For SHIB, the IOMAP shows that 6,720 addresses bought 413.41 trillion SHIB tokens at an average price of $0.000018.  

 This cohort is in the money. On the right side,13,940 addresses that purchased 1.12 trillion tokens at the same price are out of the money. Considering the closeness in resistance and support, SHIB may keep trading sideways in the short term. 

 However, if many of the 13,940 addresses decide to break even, Shiba Inu’s price will slip to $0.000016. Furthermore, the daily SHIB/USD chart indicates a similar pattern, the Fibonacci Retracement indicator reveals. 

 This indicator identifies resistance and support levels, like the IOMAP. In addition, the chart below shows a potential nominal pullback to $0.000016 as of this writing.  

 On the other hand, traders should watch out for the state of the Funding Rate. If the number of short positions continues to increase, it could catalyze the price to bounce. Should this happen, the token’s price can rise toward $0.000020.  

 This is also the region where the 0.382 Fibonacci level positions. Meanwhile, Lookonchain disclosed that a whale accumulated $6.60 million worth of SHIB on June 20.  

 Buying large amounts of cryptocurrencies like this can fuel a significant price increase. If similar orders appear in the coming days, SHIB may begin a move that takes the price closer to $0.00020, as reiterated above.

u_today:56ccf804d094b:0,Vitalik Buterin Offers Crucial New Security Practice for Ethereum,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 13:09:00 GMT",U.Today,"Vitalik Buterin believes this practice for Ethereum will bolster the network's security. The checksum address is a key concept in Ethereum that might push the risk of errors and potential losses in transactions down significantly. 

 In the ERC-3770, Buterin made some important recommendations, one of which was that this might be the best chance to require mixed-case checksum addresses. All wallets, especially those using ERC-3770, are urged by Buterin to make sure they are only producing checksummed addresses.ETHUSD Chart by TradingView 

 To help prevent errors, Ethereum addresses can be encoded using checksummed addresses, but what are checksummed addresses exactly? In an address string they mix capital and lowercase letters. EIP-55 outlines this system and shows how to use a checksum in Ethereum addresses to identify characters that have been typed incorrectly. 

 The likelihood that an incorrectly typed address will be accepted as legitimate is greatly decreased when mixed-case checksums are used in increasing the security of transactions. Beyond simply printing checksummed addresses, Buterin's proposal does more. Additionally, he proposes that input be required to have checksummed addresses. This could be done in a number of ways, such as by making it required or by including an obtrusive clickthrough if an address is entered without being checkedsummed. 

 By taking this precaution, users will be more likely to enter addresses correctly and lower the possibility of sending money to the incorrect address. Backward compatibility with numerous current hex parsers that support mixed-case addresses is one useful advantage of this approach. 

 This implies that it is possible to gradually switch to checksummed addresses without interfering with already-built systems. The checksummed addresses also retain the conventional 40-character length, which contributes to maintaining the usability and familiarity of Ethereum addresses.

the_block:df6ccfeb6094b:0,Cosmos DEX Osmosis’ DAO voting to adopt ‘fee-free’ bitcoin bridge via Nomic,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 13:00:03 GMT",The Block,"Osmosis DAO, the community governing the Cosmos-based decentralized exchange and appchain Osmosis, is set to vote in favor of adopting a ""fee-free"" bitcoin bridge via the decentralized bridging protocol Nomic. 

 Some 91.7% of votes are in currently favor of the proposal amid a 46.4% turnout, with voting due to end at 7 p.m. ET. Just 1.2% have voted against the move so far, with 7.1% abstaining. The upgrade, if approved, would mean bitcoin can move more freely into the Cosmos ecosystem for DeFi-related activities.  

 The proposal introduces a new protocol revenue-sharing arrangement between Nomic and Osmosis, aimed at enhancing bitcoin liquidity on the platform by replacing current bridging costs.  

 Nomic currently allows users to deposit bitcoin directly to Osmosis to receive its bitcoin-backed asset nBTC, with a capacity limit of 21 BTC, a deposit fee of 1% and a transfer fee of 0.5%. 

 Under the proposal, bitcoin bridging fees for transactions originating or terminating on Osmosis would be waived. However, a flat bitcoin miner fee may still be charged on withdrawals to Bitcoin to cover transaction fees. 

 In exchange, Nomic would receive a portion of the taker fees from trading of nBTC and its derivatives on Osmosis, intended to encourage its use on the chain. The proposal stipulates that Nomic would receive 10% of the total taker fees on nBTC-related trades via Osmosis, and a proportional share of fees from trades involving nBTC derivatives. 

 Osmosis users could therefore benefit from reduced costs for bitcoin transactions, enabling them to directly integrate bitcoin liquidity into the Osmosis ecosystem without incurring additional bridging fees.  

 The mechanism would be implemented during a future software upgrade if approved by both Nomic and Osmosis governance for an initial term of six months, or until superseded by mutual governance action. 

 “This proposal, if passed, is a significant milestone in DAO-to-DAO deals. It provides a new 'rev share' business model for bridges, one that is uniquely possible with appchains,” Osmosis co-founder Sunny Aggarwal wrote in the Osmosis forum. 

 What are Osmosis and Nomic? 

 Osmosis is an independent Layer 1 blockchain built using the Cosmos software development kit, specifically designed to support its decentralized exchange and automated market maker functionalities. It claims to be one of the most active ecosystems by developer activity. 

 Osmosis is one of the largest protocols in the Cosmos ecosystem, with $124 million in total value locked (deposited) on the chain, according to DeFiLlama data. It is also among the top 15 decentralized exchanges across all chains, with a cumulative trading volume of $33.8 billion. 

 Built on developer Turbofish’s Orga, a custom high-performance blockchain application framework, Nomic enables users to securely bridge bitcoin to blockchains that run the inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC), Cosmos' cross-chain messaging and bridge protocol. 

 Nomic activated its native Bitcoin (nBTC) interchain upgrade in October 2023, paving the way for native, tokenized bitcoin transfers within the Cosmos ecosystem. Before the introduction of the nBTC interchain upgrade, there were no options for users wanting to transfer bitcoin into the Cosmos Network via decentralized methods. The lack of a dedicated bridge protocol meant that users had to convert their bitcoin into other cryptocurrencies, adding an extra layer of complexity.

 Key to the process is a revenue-sharing agreement with Bitcoin bridge Nomic, according to an emailed announcement shared with CoinDesk on Friday. A bridge is a way of improving interoperability of blockchains by allowing users to move crypto assets from one system to another. 

 The revenue-sharing deal may address the one of shortcomings of bridges: how the different parties earn revenue from deposits and withdrawals. The proposed agreement will align Nomic's protocol revenue with usage of its bridged BTC, the announcement said. 

 The goal is to remove some of the friction users may previously have experienced when bridging their bitcoin holdings to other ecosystems for decentralized finance-related (DeFi) activities. 

 With less than 24 hours remaining until voting concluded, 95% of votes from the Osmosis DAO community were in favor of the deal. 

 Nomic's bridge is part of a trend of developers seeking to leverage the value tied up in BTC, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, to bring liquidity to the broader digital asset industry. In April, Nomic announced plans to integrate Babylon's Bitcoin staking protocol and introduce stBTC, a bitcoin liquid staking token.

 According to the Bithomp explorer, the recipient address for the amount of the popular cryptocurrency equivalent to $122.5 million, ""rP4X2,"" was activated on Oct. 2 last year. The activation was done by transferring 70 million XRP to this address.

DJN_DN20240621002850:0,"Standard Chartered to Start Spot Bitcoin, Ether Trading From London — Financial News","Fri, 21 Jun 2024 12:48:00 GMT",Dow Jones Newswires,"By Bilal Jafar 

 Of Financial News 

 Standard Chartered is set to become one of the first international banks to enter the spot crypto trading market as the bank readies its trading desk for the emerging asset class. 

 The new London-based crypto trading desk, which will be part of Standard Chartered's FX trading unit, will trade bitcoin and ether, the world's top two crypto assets by market capitalization, Bloomberg reported. 

 Bitcoin has a market capitalization of $1.2 trillion, while ether's market value stands at around $428 billion, according to Coinmarketcap. 

 Standard Chartered's spot crypto trading desk to trade bitcoin and ether won't be the firm's first foray into the multi-trillion dollar emerging asset class. The firm backed the launch of Zodia Markets, a crypto exchange and a brokerage platform, in 2021. 

 Standard Chartered also has a stake in crypto custodian Zodia Custody. 

 Institutional interest in spot crypto trading has jumped after the SEC's approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in January. Some of the world's largest hedge funds, including Izzy Englander's Millennium Management and Paul Singer's Elliott Management started buying spot bitcoin ETFs in the first quarter. 

 Banks weren't far behind in the bitcoin ETF mania. Morgan Stanley owned roughly $270 million in bitcoin ETFs as of March 31, CoinDesk reported. 

 Standard Chartered said that the firm is working closely with regulators to support demand from institutional clients to trade bitcoin and ether. 

 Nomura is another banking giant that has been betting big on crypto for years. The bank established crypto trading and asset management firm Laser Digital in September 2022. Nomura appointed its chief digital officer Jez Mohideen as the CEO of Laser Digital. 

 Nomura also established crypto custodian Komainu as a joint venture in 2018 with CoinShares and Ledger.

cointelegraph:d802ffe50094b:0,"Centralized crypto exchanges are key for mass adoption, despite FTX collapse ","Fri, 21 Jun 2024 12:45:13 GMT",Cointelegraph,"Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs) are still the key to attracting more mainstream retail adopters as the industry moves on from the notorious collapse of the FTX exchange. 

 Despite the collapse of the FTX exchange, which caused at least $8.9 billion in lost user funds, CEXs remain the first layer of interaction for retail adopters buying their first cryptocurrency. 

 The next 100 million retail adopters will likely onboard the industry through CEXs, according to Ruslan Fakhrutdinov, the founder and CEO of cryptocurrency trading platform X10. Speaking exclusively to Cointelegraph, Fakhrutdinov said that centralized exchanges would likely drive user adoption: 

 The primary reason for new investors choosing CEXs is because of the element of trust in the underlying company, along with a more intuitive trading experience.  

 To attract more traditional retail investors, hybrid and decentralized exchanges need an improved user experience and renewed marketing efforts, explained Fakhrutdinov: 

 X10 positions itself as a hybrid exchange platform and was founded by team members who previously worked at neo-bank Revolut. Its infrastructure features a hybrid central limit order book that executes trade settlements on-chain through StarkEx's layer-2 engine.

newsbtc:d87ece9bc094b:0,Here’s Why The Worldcoin (WLD) Price Surged Over 15% In One Day To Reach $3,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 12:30:51 GMT",NewsBTC,"Worldcoin (WLD) is currently enjoying an upward trend, with the crypto token surging by over 15% in a single day to reach $3. This development is thanks to the recent strides that the Worldcoin team has made to achieve the goals of the crypto project.  

 Expansion Of Worldcoin’s World ID Provides Bullish Momentum 

 The Worldcoin team recently announced that World ID, the project’s global identity network, would be making an entry into Ecuador. Locals in the country can get verified using the Orb to join Worldcoin’s identity network. The team mentioned that verifications will be available at six locations across two Ecuadorian cities.  

 Verification will begin at the port city of Guayaquil on June 26, while the other verification locations will be set up in the Capital city of Quito on June 27. Worldcoin stated that anyone 18 years or older who is interested in joining the over 5 million people participating in the Worldcoin network can get Orb verified in either of those two cities.  

 This development undoubtedly provides bullish momentum for the Worldcoin token, considering the role the crypto token plays in achieving the team’s vision of providing a global identity for everyone. Worldcoin’s entry into Ecuador is also a much-needed boost, given the regulatory scrutiny and negative publicity that has overwhelmed Worldcoin’s ecosystem.  

 Worldcoin also noted that its upcoming launch in Ecuador comes at a time when the project is set to expand further in Argentina through direct investments in the country and the launch of more Orb verification locations. As part of the investment, Worldcoin contributors such as Tools for Humanity (TFH) will sponsor professional opportunities for at least 50 developers, operations specialists, software engineers, data analysts, and other professionals in the country.  

 Additionally, Worldcoin announced that 50 World ID orb verification locations, including two experience stores, will be set up in over ten cities across Argentina. These locations are expected to open sometime during the summer in the country.  

 More Good News For Worldcoin 

 Kenya’s local media, The Star, recently reported that the government has dropped its investigation into Worldcoin. Worldcoin had earlier had to suspend its World ID verifications in the country following allegations of unlawful collection and transfer of personal data belonging to locals.  

 However, upon investigating and reviewing these allegations, the country’s Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) determined that they had no substance and directed that the investigation be dropped with no further action from law enforcement agencies. The Star noted that this development will likely pave the way for Worldcoin to resume its operations in Kenya.  

 Worldcoin’s operations in Kenya were largely successful. Over 635,000 Kenyans are said to have downloaded the World App, although more than half of these individuals had yet to verify their identity using the Orb.

u_today:d3ee80e46094b:0,"Big Break Coming for Ethereum (ETH) DeFi, Here's Reason","Fri, 21 Jun 2024 12:28:00 GMT",U.Today,"The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector within the Ethereum network is poised for a major breakthrough. This projection is based on recent observations within the ecosystem and the broader cryptocurrency space. Renowned analyst and cofounder of Syncracy Capital, Ryan Watkins, asserts that the current setup for Ethereum DeFi is the strongest it has been since 2020. 

 DeFi’s strong revenue growth and low valuations 

 The optimism lies in several factors such as the volume of revenue, upgrades in technology and the pending spot Ethereum exchange-traded-funds, ETFs, awaiting the final nod by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

 Per Watkins' analysis, DeFi leaders are seeing record-high revenues, while their valuations are at historic lows. This combination of high revenue and low valuation presents a compelling opportunity to investors. 

 The setup for Ethereum DeFi is the strongest its been since 2020. 

 DeFi leaders are generating all-time high revenues across the board, yet valuations are the cheapest they've been in history. 

 Better yet, these revenues will likely accelerate from here as DeFi leaders rollout… pic.twitter.com/WmaajQIpxI— Ryan Watkins (@RyanWatkins_) June 20, 2024 

 Some of the leading DeFi applications on the Ethereum network, such as Lido, MakerDAAO, Uniswap and Aave have recorded progressive increases in revenues, surpassing their 2022 peaks. Aave's annualized revenue for 2022 was just over $500 million. However, in May 2024, it reached an all-time high of $750 million. 

 Furthermore, this revenue is expected to grow even more as DeFi leaders implement major upgrades, such as Maker's Endgame and Uniswap V4. 

 Additionally, the introduction of the Ethereum ETF is anticipated to spark renewed interest in the Ethereum economy. Despite facing a challenging regulatory environment since ""DeFi summer,"" the sector is gradually seeing improvements. Although there are no major policy changes expected in the near term, the overall narrative is becoming more favorable. 

 Market momentum and future prospects 

 Watkins insists that as long as the long-term bullish trend continues, DeFi should benefit from positive momentum, given its highly cyclical nature. Market experts are optimistic that more and more users will be attracted by the DeFi offerings, further fueling growth. 

 Although Uniswap is yet to generate any revenue, Watkins maintains that the potential for activating the fee switch seems imminent.

beincrypto:eded627bc094b:0,Biggest Altcoin Gainers of the Third Week of June 2024,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 12:15:00 GMT",Beincrypto,"The week under review has seen a decline in trading activity in the cryptocurrency market. Within that period, global cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by 4%. These are the top altcoins gainers for the third week of June. 

 The altcoin market has seen a 6% drop in dominance during this period. However, some altcoins, such as Ethereum Name Service (ENS), Lido LDOUSD, and Pendle (PENDLE), have still been able to grow their prices by double digits in the past seven days. 

 Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Leads the Altcoin Market With the Most Gains  

 ENS, the native token that powers Ethereum Name Service, the Ethereum-based decentralized domain name system, has seen its price rise by 20% in the past seven days. It currently trades at $25.31. 

 It has seen a surge in trading activity during the period under review. In fact, on June 19, ENS’ daily trading volume climbed to a monthly high of $237 million. The double-digit price hike is partly attributable to the positive weighted sentiment that has trailed the altcoin since June 17. By June 19, this had climbed to a 30-day high of 1.21.  

 An asset’s weighted sentiment tracks the overall mood of the market regarding it. The metric considers the sentiment following the asset and the volume of social media discussions. When its value is positive, market sentiment is bullish. 

 Confirming the bullish trend, ENS’ Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) are currently in uptrends. ENS’ RSI is 59.21, while its MFI is 61.05. 

 These indicators measure overbought and oversold market conditions by tracking an asset’s price changes. They range from 0 to 100, with values above 70 suggesting that an asset is overbought and due for a correction, while values below 30 signal that the asset is oversold and may witness a rebound. 

 At their current values, ENS’ RSI and MFI suggest that buying pressure is significant and continues to outweigh selling activity.  

 If ENS’ demand continues to skyrocket, its price might trend toward $27.59. 

 However, if sellers begin to make a profit at this point, the token’s price might fall to $25.21. 

 Lido LDOUSD Clears Key Moving Averages 

 LDO, the governance token of Ethereum’s largest liquid staking protocol, Lido Finance, has witnessed a 13% price hike during the week under review. 

 The hike in LDO’s trading activity in the past few days has caused it to trade significantly above its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (blue) and 50-day Small Moving Average (SMA) (yellow). 

 An asset’s 20-day EMA tracks its average price over the past 20 trading days, while its 50-day SMA measures its average closing price over the last 50 days.  

 When an asset trades above these key moving averages, it indicates a strong bullish trend. By trading above the 20-day EMA, the asset’s price shows a short-term uptrend, while trading above the 50-day SMA indicates a longer-term upward trend. 

 LDO’s Aroon Up Line confirms the strength of the current uptrend. At press time, the indicator’s value is 85.71%. 

 An asset’s Aroon Indicator measures its trend strength and potential price reversal points. When the Up Line is at or near 100%, the market uptrend is strong, and the most recent high was reached relatively recently. 

 If the uptrend continues, LDO might touch $2.41. 

 However, if the bears re-emerge and gain market control, they may force the token’s price downward toward $2.13. 

 Pendle (PENDLE) Holders Pocket Gains 

 PENDLE is the governance token of Pendle, a protocol focused on yield generation and management across decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. 

 Trading at $5.78 at press time, the altcoin’s value has rallied by 11% in the past seven days. The period under review has also been marked by a spike in the token’s daily trading volume.  

 On-chain data revealed that on June 19, PENDLE’s daily trading volume was $121 million, representing its highest since May 28.  

 Readings from the altcoin’s moving average convergence divergence (MACD) confirmed the bullish bias toward it. The MACD line (blue) rallied above the signal line (orange) and gears to cross above the zero line.  

 An asset’s MACD indicator tracks its price changes and trend strength. When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it generally suggests increasing upward momentum. When the MACD line rallies above the zero line, it confirms the bullish trend in the market. Traders often interpret this to mean that the asset’s price will continue to grow. 

 If the sentiment trailing PENDLE remains bullish, its price may rally to $6.19. 

 However, if this projection is invalidated by a bearish takeover, PENDLE’s price may fall to $5.79.

 Backed by heavyweights like Polychain Capital and Tribe Capital, Grass has secured about $4.5 million in funding. 

 U2U Network: Enhancing User Engagement with NFTs and Loyalty Points 

 Next, the U2U Network, a layer-1 blockchain tailored for DePin, is revitalizing its user base through an airdrop campaign. It has reintroduced the U2Quest, pushing users to complete on-chain tasks and earn non-fungible token NFTUSDT rewards. 

 Moreover, participants are encouraged to engage in social tasks on Galxe to collect loyalty points and climb the leaderboard for rewards. According to data from Crunchbase, U2U Network has raised $10 million from three rounds, the most recent being a Seed round on July 1, 2023. 

 Chirp Tracker App Campaign Starts Next Week 

 Lastly, Chirp, a DePin telecommunications network for the Internet of Things (IoT) and voice communication, is making strides. Today, Chirp announced its Chirp Tracker App Campaign, starting next week as the first stage of its airdrop campaign. 

 This move aims to engage users in using their smartphones extensively, striving for the highest CHIRP rewards in a competitive setting. Indeed, Chirp’s initiative indicates a strategic approach to boosting user involvement and network expansion. 

 These airdrops are strategic elements of each project’s roadmap to achieve wider token distribution and heightened user engagement.

cointelegraph:ee916b793094b:0,Customers protest exchange bankruptcy plan: ‘We never gave FTX our coins!’,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 11:59:00 GMT",Cointelegraph,"Some FTX customers are objecting to the troubled exchange’s Dec. 16 proposed bankruptcy plan, stating that it violates their property rights and sells their assets to pay off third-party creditors, including the United States government.  

 On June 19, a representative of the FTX customers told Cointelegraph that they wanted their cryptocurrency returned to them instead of being paid a cash balance, stating: “We never gave FTX our coins.” A May 9 Los Angeles Times report had previously said that “nearly all customers of FTX will get their money back, plus interest” if the bankruptcy plan is approved. 

 The objection to the plan comes from the FTX Customers Ad Hoc Committee, a group formed to represent the interests of FTX customers in the bankruptcy case.Cointelegraph 

 In a June 19 conversation with Cointelegraph, committee board member Sunil Kavuri claimed that the bankruptcy plan violates creditors’ property rights.  

 According to him, the FTX case is often compared to that of crypto lending firm Celsius and its bankruptcy. However, Kavuri believes this comparison is incorrect, saying that “the key difference with Celsius is the terms of service.” While Celsius customers signed over the title to their crypto when they agreed to the terms of service, FTX customers never did this. As a result, the funds remain their property, he claimed. “We never gave our coins to FTX,” Kavuri stated. “If we don’t give [the] title of our coins to FTX, [then] FTX is obligated to return those coins.” 

 Kavuri also claimed that FTX is attempting to sell customer assets to pay back its unsecured creditors. These creditors include the U.S. government, amongst others. “They're overpaying IRS fines and CFTC fines. […] Why should victims be paying these fines?” he asked rhetorically. The exchange has also used customer funds to pay back Alameda lenders such as Genesis and Binance, he argued, stating that Binance “is walking off with like $1.2 billion, which was customer deposits [FTX] used to pay for the Binance stake.” 

 Kavuri’s view contrasts with the FTX estate's, which reportedly said the plan would allow customers to receive everything they are owed. According to a May 9 Los Angeles Times report, FTX claimed that “nearly all customers of FTX will get their money back, plus interest,” if the plan is approved. All customers owed less than $50,000 “will get about 118% of their claim,” the report stated. 

 Kavuri denied that customers would be made whole under the plan. He argued that the exchange does not have a legal basis to pay back customers using cash and must return their property, the cryptocurrency itself, rather than selling the crypto at a profit and keeping some of the profits for itself or third parties: 

 On June 5, Kavuri and other customers filed a motion to stop the bankruptcy plan from being offered up for a vote. According to the motion, the plan assumes customers’ cryptocurrency belongs to the FTX estate and “ignores [...] whether the assets the Debtors seek to distribute through the Plan are actually property of the Debtors’ estates.” 

 The motion asks the court to reject the plan’s disclosure statement on the grounds that the plan is “unconfirmable as a matter of law.” If the disclosure statement is rejected, it would mean the current version of the plan is rejected. 

 On Dec. 16, 2023, the FTX estate filed a proposed order to approve the disclosure statement for the bankruptcy plan. The estate disclosed the plan itself on May 7, and a hearing to approve the statement is scheduled for June 25.Cointelegraph 

 If the plan is allowed to go forward, the deadline for voting in favor or against it will be Aug. 16 at 8:00 pm UTC, according to a more recent version of the proposed order. 

 Some FTX customers have stated that they support the bankruptcy plan, arguing that it will allow customers to receive at least some of their funds back quickly. In a response to a post from Kavuri, X user Sgd claimed that the customers should support the plan since their property can’t be returned anyway. 

 “I still fail to understand how you want them to return 1:1 cryptos when they simply didn’t have them,” Sgd stated. “There is no money to return 1:1 crypto, there wasn’t even 1% of BTC deposits in BTC.” In another reply, they predicted the plan would be approved: “I believe plan will go through because 98% of creditors in the convenience will vote yes, so they’d just need another class to accept it. [...] People just want their $ back, so 119% is fine for most of them.”  

 Property rights is not the only issue being fought over in the FTX bankruptcy case. In February, FTX customer Edwin Garrison launched a lawsuit against the firm’s legal representatives, Sullivan & Cromwell, alleging it profited from the exchange’s fraud. An independent examiner concluded on May 24 that there was not sufficient evidence to prove the law firm knew about the fraud. According to a June 4 report from Law.com, the examiner has now ordered a second investigation into the law firm’s activities. 

 The Customer Ad-Hoc Committee and the estate are also fighting over assets seized by former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried during his criminal trial.  

 The closure of FTX was one of the most spectacular crypto exchange collapses in history. An estimated $8 billion in cryptocurrency was lost when the exchange stopped processing withdrawals. Bankman-Fried was subsequently convicted of fraud and sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in the exchange's bankruptcy

coindesk:f1eb9910e094b:0,Meme Coin Liquidity Hits Record High Even as Bid-Ask Spread Spotlights Risk,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 11:55:22 GMT",CoinDesk,"Executing trades in prominent meme coins is easier than ever now that liquidity, as measured by 1% market depth, has surged to record highs, according to data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko. 

 The combined figure for DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, WIF, BONK, GROK, BABYDOGE, FLOKI, MEME, HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu and HarryPotterObamaSonic, recently rose to $128 million, the data shows. The figure describes the total value of buy and sell orders within a 1% range of the current market price. The deeper the liquidity – that is, the higher the figure – the easier it is to execute large orders at stable prices. 

 Generally, increased liquidity leads to a narrower gap between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest a seller is willing to accept, the bid-ask spread. Tighter spreads ensure better trading pricing and reduce the cost of executing trades. Meme coins, however, aren't responding, according to Kaiko, and the bid-ask spreads remain above 2 basis points on most centralized exchanges. 

 ""This suggests that while more market makers are venturing into providing liquidity for these tokens, they are still considered risky due to their high volatility,"" Kaiko added. 

 ""While part of this increase is related to price appreciations, many small-cap meme tokens such as Dogwifhat (WIF), Memecoin (MEME), or Book of Meme (BOME) have seen significant growth in liquidity in native units, ranging from 200% to 4000%,"" Kaiko said in a weekly newsletter.

 The face-off will compare both candidates’ proposed policies. Amid this scenario, analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex predict that political memecoins or “Politifi” tokens inspired by Trump and Biden—such as the Ethereum-based Super Trump and Maga, and the Solana-based, misspelled, Jeo Boden and Doland Tremp—could experience volatile price movements during and after the debate. 

 ""There could be significant movement for 'Politifi' tokens during and after the debate depending on their performance as these tokens have turned into speculative assets themselves in terms of the election results,"" Bitfinex analysts told The Block. The analysts added that it is important to note that Trump has positioned himself as the ""Crypto President"". 

 While the Trump vs. Biden debate may briefly discuss regulatory frameworks affecting cryptocurrencies, the analysts added that detailed policy announcements and legislative processes typically provide more substantial clarity than debate soundbites. 

 The analysts emphasized that market interest and potential impacts could arise from discussions concerning general capital gains taxes and specific crypto taxation policies. 

 ""What could be interesting and have market impact is discussion around capital gains taxes in general and crypto taxation policies in particular,"" they added. 

 PolitiFi tokens market cap 

 The market cap of political-themed tokens stands at $998 million currently, reflecting a -10.6% change over the last 24 hours, according to Coingecko's PolitiFi token category. 

 Several prominent memecoins inspired by the presidential candidates have experienced significant declines in value in the past 24 hours. 

 The Ethereum-based ConstitutionDAO (ticker: PEOPLE) has dropped by 11.6% today. Similarly, the Ethereum-based MAGA (ticker: Trump) has seen a decline of 7.6%, while the Ethereum-based MAGA Hat (ticker: MAGA) slid by 18.5% over the past day. 

 On the Solana blockchain, Jeo Boden (ticker: BODEN) has recorded a substantial decline of 26.7%, and Doland Tremp (ticker: TREMP) has fallen by 16.8%. Meanwhile, the Ethereum-based Super Trump (ticker: STRUMP) has experienced a more modest decrease of 3.7%.

 Since March, The Open Network has been turning heads as capital flows into the ecosystem and user activity breaks one record by another.  

 Binance Integrates USDT Support on TON 

 Binance has announced adding USDT on TON blockchain. With this integration, it has opened the space for deposits and withdrawals.  

 The update is pivotal for TON, seeing as USDT is the largest stablecoin on market capitalization metrics. Stablecoins offer essential stability in the volatile blockchain market, with USDT maintaining its dominance due to its liquidity, accessibility, integration with decentralized finance (DeFi), and utility in cross-border transactions. 

 In April, USDT issuer Tether announced its collaboration with TON. This alliance aims to offer crypto transactions worldwide, providing financial solutions for unbanked populations. This partnership is set to create a borderless financial system through decentralized technology, improving accessibility and transaction efficiency. 

 Interestingly, Toncoin, the native token of TON blockchain, still lacks a spot listing on Binance. Currently, the ninth-largest cryptocurrency is available only in the form of perpetual futures. 

 However, the exchange may surrender under TON’s growing demand. CryptoQuant community manager and analyst Maarten highlighted The Open Network as one of the most popular blockchains. He cited various on-chain metrics skyrocketing, indicating the network’s steady growth. 

 Toncoin’s On-chain Metrics on Rise 

 Key on-chain metrics show significant growth in The Open Network, starting with the transfer volume. This metric shows the total on-chain amount of tokens in USD transacted for a given asset in a given time interval. Maarten observes that the total value of transactions conducted through the TON blockchain ranges between $5 billion and $10 billion. 

 Relative to Bitcoin’s average daily transfer volume of around $50 billion, TON has already achieved between 10% of the capacity BTC recorded. Given TON is only four years old, this is not a mean feat. 

 Another on-chain metric that points to massive growth for TON chain is Toncoin’s holder count. This metric quantifies the number of distinct addresses holding a token across predefined balance intervals, offering insight into ownership distribution.  

 Maarten’s analysis shows 32 million Toncoin holders, up from 2.9 million a year ago. This represents a 1003% increase within a year and points to the growing popularity of the TON token.

 Spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded a fifth straight day of outflows on Thursday, taking their total losses for the week to $900 million, the highest outflow activity since late April. Data tracked by SoSoValue shows that the 11 listed ETFs lost $140 million on Thursday, with $1.1 billion in trading volumes. Grayscale’s GBTC – which has mostly seen outflows since its conversion to an ETF in January – led with $53 million followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at $51 million. BlackRock’s IBIT, the biggest ETF by assets held, was the only product with net inflows, adding $1 million. The others saw zero net change. 

 Standard Chartered is establishing a spot trading desk for bitcoin and ether, Bloomberg reported on Friday. The London-based desk will start operations soon and be part of the bank's FX trading unit, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. Standard Chartered would become one of the first global banks to enter spot cryptocurrency trading, though others, such as Goldman Sachs, have been trading crypto derivatives for several years. Standard Chartered's involvement in cryptocurrency is now well established, as a backer of digital asset custodian Zodia Custody and its exchange arm Zodia Markets.

cointelegraph:7a724f924094b:0," What is Tether’s gold-backed stablecoin, ‘Alloy’ (aUSD₮)? ","Fri, 21 Jun 2024 11:39:00 GMT",Cointelegraph," What is a tethered asset?  

 Tethered assets are a versatile class of digital tokens designed to track the price of various reference assets, such as the United States dollar. 

 Also termed stablecoins, tethered assets can be backed by a single type of collateral, such as gold, a specific fiat currency, or a diversified portfolio of multiple assets, offering greater flexibility and risk management options. This flexibility allows tethered assets to track the price of a wide range of assets, including major fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar or euro, commodities such as gold, oil and wheat, or even other financial instruments like stocks or bonds.  

 Tethered assets maintain their peg to the underlying asset through various mechanisms, often combining overcollateralization with robust liquidity pools on secondary markets. By holding reserves exceeding the value of the issued assets and ensuring smooth trading in secondary markets, these strategies aim to stabilize the value of the tethered asset and closely align it with its reference asset. 

 A well-known example of tethered assets is Tether USDTUSD, which claims its reserves match the quantity of USDT in circulation. It aims to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar. Despite its growth, Tether has faced scrutiny and regulatory challenges due to depegging events. 

 To address such issues, Tether regularly undergoes independent attestations to verify its reserves in response to regulatory scrutiny. In April 2024, Tether completed a System and Organization Controls 2 (SOC) audit, which is the highest level of security compliance. Additionally, it publishes quarterly reports detailing its reserves and asset composition to enhance the transparency of its operations. 

  Alloy (aUSD₮) by Tether, explained  

 Alloy (aUSD₮) by Tether is minted using EVM-compatible smart contracts and leverages Tether Gold (XAU₮), a digital representation of physical gold, for stability. 

 AUSD₮ is the first Alloy by Tether designed to track the U.S. dollar using Tether Gold as collateral. It is minted using Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible smart contracts, allowing for smooth interoperability and integration within the broader Ethereum ecosystem and its various compatible blockchains. 

 Using Tether Gold (XAU₮) as collateral, Alloy by Tether positions itself as a digital asset anchored to the stability and scarcity of gold, a traditional store of value known for its low volatility. XAU₮ is an ERC-20 token equal to one troy ounce (31.1 grams) of gold on the Ethereum blockchain. Each blockchain address holding XAU₮ is associated with real gold stored in a Switzerland vault on behalf of Tether Gold tokenholders. 

 But is Alloy by Tether licensed in any jurisdiction? Alloy by Tether is a technological platform that utilizes smart contracts. However, the National Commission of Digital Assets (CNAD) in El Salvador authorizes Moon Gold NA, S.A. de C.V., and Moon Gold El Salvador, S.A. de C.V. to handle issuing and management of aUSD₮. 

 How to interact with the Alloy by Tether smart contracts? 

 Alloy by Tether smart contracts are accessible through the platform’s user-friendly web interface, where users can mint and redeem aUSD₮ using XAU₮. The web interface is readily accessible at alloy.tether.to.  

 Technically proficient individuals can interact directly with the contracts using specialized tools. It’s important to note that only verified Ethereum addresses that have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) checks can engage with these smart contracts. Further information can be obtained via front-end documentation on Alloy by Tether. 

  How Alloy (aUSD₮) works  

 AUSD₮ blends the stability of the U.S. dollar with the value-preserving characteristics of gold, serving as a stable unit of account. Three core tenets of the functionality of aUSD₮ are overcollateralization, vaults and its liquidation mechanism: 

 Overcollateralization 

 A key feature of aUSD₮ is overcollateralization. AUSD₮ tokens are backed by a greater value of Tether Gold (XAU₮) than its face value. This surplus XAU₮ acts as a buffer, safeguarding the stability of aUSD₮ against potential fluctuations in the price of gold. This means that users must deposit a larger value of collateral than the value of aUSD₮ they intend to mint. 

 By locking a specified amount of Tether Gold into a smart contract, a user can mint a corresponding amount of aUSD₮. The maximum aUSD₮ one can mint is determined by a collateral-to-asset ratio, known as the liquidation point. 

 Alloy by Tether Vaults 

 Ethereum-compatible core smart contracts termed Vaults are used for minting and managing aUSD₮. These smart contracts facilitate independent and permissionless verification of the XAU₮ collateral backing aUSD₮ circulation. 

 Vaults play multiple roles in aUSD₮ ecosystem: 

 Only addresses that have successfully completed a KYC verification process can interact with the vaults and mint aUSD₮. These verified addresses are whitelisted for the minting process.  

 Cointelegraph 

 The vault utilizes this data to assess the position’s solvency. If it nears liquidation, authorized liquidators are permitted to intervene, extracting the user’s XAU₮ and returning a corresponding amount of aUSD₮ not exceeding the minted amount. This mechanism safeguards the system’s integrity and protects against undercollateralization. 

 Each vault uses a designated oracle to determine the prices of both XAU₮ tokens and the corresponding tethered asset. For aUSD₮, the tether asset oracle specifically tracks the U.S. dollar price, establishing a 1:1 peg between aUSD₮ and $1. 

 As the Vault technology automates the processes of minting, redeeming and liquidating aUSD₮ while ensuring transparency and trust in the system, it is crucial for the functioning and security of the Alloy by Tether system. 

 Liquidation of collateral 

 Liquidation occurs when the value of the collateral backing a minted amount falls below a predetermined threshold. Each CMP has a liquidation point of 75%, defined by the maximum MTV ratio, representing the maximum proportion of the collateral’s value that can be minted. A CMP, in this context, refers to the amount of aUSD₮ minted by a user backed by a specific amount of XAU₮ held as collateral in the vault. 

 If a position nears its liquidation threshold, authorized liquidators intervene to liquidate the position, reclaiming the user’s XAU₮ and returning aUSD₮ up to the initially minted amount. Liquidators manage positions nearing liquidation by acquiring the collateral at a small discount in exchange for returning aUSD₮. They may purchase part or all of the collateral, depending on the situation and the agreed discount. 

  How to acquire Alloy (aUSD₮)  

 Users can obtain aUSD₮ by depositing XAU₮ to the aUSD₮ smart contract or trading it on exchanges like Bitfinex. Fees apply for minting, returning and liquidating aUSD₮. 

 Users can obtain aUSD₮ by transferring XAU﻿₮ to the aUSD₮ smart contract, which then mints and issues a corresponding amount of aUSD₮ directly to the user’s address or trading aUSD₮ on the secondary market via centralized exchanges like Bitfinex or decentralized exchanges (DEXs). 

 Cointelegraph 

 The Alloy by Tether charges three types of fees, measured in basis points (bps). A basis point is a unit of measurement used to describe a percentage or a difference in interest rates or yields. One basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1% or 0.01%.  

 Mint fee 

 The mint fee refers to the fee incurred by users when creating new aUSD₮ tokens. At present, it is charged at 25 bps on each newly minted aUSD₮. 

 Return fee 

 The return fee is the fee paid by users when redeeming aUSD₮ tokens for their underlying collateral. Currently, a fee of 25 bps is applied on each aUSD₮ return. 

 Liquidation fee 

 A liquidation fee is a charge incurred by users when their collateralized position (the ratio of XAU₮ to aUSD₮) falls below a certain threshold, triggering a liquidation event. At present, 75 bps are charged to the liquidators on each liquidation of XAU₮, implying that for every XAU₮ token a liquidator acquires during a liquidation event, they must pay a fee of 0.05% of its value. 

 It is worth noting that the liquidation fee is different from the liquidation premium, which is a discount on liquidated XAU₮ used to incentivize liquidators to maintain system solvency. In contrast, the liquidation fee is paid by the liquidator to the platform or protocol and helps cover the operational costs associated with the liquidation process. 

  What are the advantages of aUSD₮?  

 AUSD₮ offers various advantages, including stability through its dollar peg and gold backing and transparency through auditable smart contracts. 

 AUSD₮, backed by Tether Gold (XAU₮), offers a unique investment opportunity. The U.S. dollar peg and the intrinsic value of gold, a well-known safe-haven asset, stabilize the stablecoin. This combination reduces volatility frequently connected to cryptocurrencies by providing a reliable store of value.  

 Furthermore, aUSD₮ is based on the Ethereum blockchain and utilizes auditable smart contracts, providing secure, transparent minting and redemption processes. The overcollateralization model and compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem further facilitate yield generation and seamless integration with different decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.  

 Functioning entirely onchain, it offers a resilient alternative to the traditional banking system, providing investors with stability, diversity and passive income opportunities (e.g., a yield from overcollateralization). 

  Tether’s fiat-pegged tokens (USD₮) vs. Tether Gold tokens (XAU₮), vs. Alloy by Tether (aUSD₮)  

 USDT is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar; XAU₮, a gold-backed token representing one troy ounce of physical gold and offered by TG Commodities Limited; and aUSD₮ is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar but backed by Tether Gold (XAU₮).  

 While Tether (USDT) is designed for everyday transactions, XAU₮ is ideal for investors seeking exposure to gold, and aUSD₮ combines the dollar’s stability with the security of gold, offering potential yield generation through its unique overcollateralization mechanism. 

 The table below explains the key differences between Tether’s fiat-pegged tokens (like USDT), Tether Gold tokens (XAU₮) and Alloy by Tether (aUSD₮) across various parameters: 

 Cointelegraph 

  How can users retrieve XAU₮ deposited as collateral?  

 Users can retrieve deposited XAU₮ by requesting a withdrawal. To avoid denial, the MTV ratio must stay below 75% (liquidation point).  

 Users must initiate a withdrawal request from Alloy using the Tether Vault smart contract. If the withdrawal causes the MTV ratio to surpass the 75% liquidation point, the request will be denied. This is to ensure the system remains overcollateralized. 

 A withdrawal request will not be approved if it increases the MTV ratio beyond 75%. In such situations, users can lower their MTV ratio by returning a portion of their minted aUSD₮ before trying to withdraw again. Also, it’s crucial to remember that withdrawing XAU₮ without a corresponding return of aUSD₮ increases the MTV ratio, thus raising the liquidation risk. 

 Furthermore, to recover all deposited XAU₮, users must return the entire minted amount of aUSD₮ they minted. This may require buying back some aUSD₮ on the secondary market to compensate for the deficit and successfully complete the withdrawal process.  

 So when is repurchasing aUSD₮ needed for XAU₮ withdrawal? Users pay a minting fee when they mint aUSD₮. Similarly, when they return aUSD₮ to redeem their XAU₮ collateral, a return fee is charged. These fees are deducted in aUSD₮. 

 That’s why a user must return all of the aUSD₮ they minted before withdrawing all of their XAU₮; however, due to the fees incurred during minting and returning, the amount of aUSD₮ they have might not be enough to cover the full return, and they need to purchase additional aUSD₮ on the secondary market.

SHIB's burn rate has surged 529.72% in the last 24 hours, per the latest data from Shibburn. 

 Moreover, around 37.53 million SHIB tokens have been burned during this time. This is an exciting update for the Shiba Inu community as this latest surge adds to the rising number of tokens being sent to dead wallets. 

 As of this publication, around 410.7 trillion tokens have been burned from the initial circulation supply of the coin. Notably, the current supply of the meme coin is 583.3 trillion tokens. This continuous burning of Shiba Inu coins is a highly bullish move for a number of reasons. 

 For example, the reducing circulation supply of a coin makes it deflationary in nature. We know that Bitcoin BTCUSD has a limited supply of 21 million coins. This unique aspect makes it one of the most deflationary coins in the industry, which eventually leaves a positive impact on the BTC price. 

 While Shiba Inu has a very high supply, the constant burning of these tokens can also leave a positive impact on its price. It may not be as good as Bitcoin, but it can still make SHIB one of the deflationary cryptocurrencies on the market. 

 What does it mean for Shiba Inu price? 

 Meanwhile, the current price of SHIB is still struggling, along with the broader market. According to CoinMarketCap, Shiba Inu is currently trading at $0.00001776, down 4.83% in the last 24 hours. The market cap of the meme coin is also down 4.82%, currently at $10.47 billion. 

 While the latest surge in the burn rate has not helped the SHIB price, it is expected that it will leave a positive impact in the long-term. Sending 37.53 million tokens to dead wallets is part of a major effort. It needs to be a continuous process, which will eventually give a major boost to this highly popular meme coin.

 This move makes Standard Chartered one of the first global banks to enter spot crypto trading. 

 Standard Chartered Leads Banks into Spot Bitcoin and Ether Trading 

 According to sources, the bank’s new crypto trading desk will operate from London. It will be a part of its foreign exchange (FX) trading unit. However, no further details were provided until the time of publication. 

 The report further reveals that Standard Chartered emphasized its commitment to regulatory compliance while supporting institutional clients in trading Bitcoin and Ethereum. The news has sparked enthusiasm within the crypto community, with notable figures like Binance CEO Richard Teng expressing their excitement. 

 “Welcome to crypto, Standard Chartered,” Teng remarked. 

 The bank already backs two crypto firms, Zodia Custody and Zodia Markets. These firms provide various services, from custody to over-the-counter trading for institutional clients. Additionally, Standard Chartered launched its blockchain unit, Libeara, in November through its investment arm, SC Ventures. 

 Libeara has been a notable participant in the fintech sector, particularly highlighted by its role as a finalist in the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) Global Retail CBDC Challenge. The company has a track record of implementing digital platform prototypes, which governments in Hong Kong, Ghana, and the Philippines have utilized. 

 Moreover, Libeara is dedicated to innovating within the financial sector by facilitating the tokenization of traditional assets. One of its key initiatives includes the creation of a tokenized government bond fund denominated in Singaporean dollars (SGD). 

 Standard Chartered’s foray into the spot crypto trading segment signifies increasing acceptance of digital assets among traditional financial institutions. This pioneering move could set a precedent, encouraging other conventional financial entities to engage with the thriving digital asset market.

beincrypto:f56698869094b:0,Tezos (XTZ) Price Consolidation Continues as Bulls and Bears Battle,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 11:11:38 GMT",Beincrypto,"Tezos’s (XTZ) price could reclaim some of the losses witnessed in the last couple of days; however, this would warrant a change in investors’ behavior. 

 Their sentiment would need to shift from bearish to bullish to support a recovery rally. 

 Tezos’ Investors Send Mixed Signals 

 XTZ price has a shot at climbing back the charts since the investors are slowly increasing the capital invested in the asset. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator shows a significant surge in Tezos’ inflows. This is a positive sign, indicating an increase in buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. 

 This uptick in CMF suggests that more investors could be moving to accumulate XTZ. Increased buying pressure often correlates with upward price movement, reflecting growing confidence in the asset. 

 However, Tezos’s funding rate fluctuates between positive and negative territory. This volatility points to a lack of consensus among investors about the short-term direction of the market. 

 Positive funding rates generally hint at long contracts dominating the market, whereas negative rates suggest short contracts are leading. In the case of XTZ, though, this volatility in the funding rate points to a lack of consensus among investors about the short-term direction of the market. 

 This could result in sideways movement in XTZ price. 

 XTZ Price Prediction: Recovery From Lows 

 The XTZ price is currently at a seven-month low of $0.79, bouncing back from $0.76. The altcoin fell below $0.70 during this week, touching $0.68. While the altcoin has bounced back, it may not see a rally anytime soon. 

 The mixed signals from investors point towards a period of consolidation for Tezos. XTZ could thus remain constricted within $0.76 and $0.87.  

 A breakout or breakdown would invalidate the bullish-neutral thesis, sending the XTZ price rallying or falling. The targets for the former condition are $0.94, while for the other, they are $0.60.

This major transaction has caught the attention of the SHIB community and the broader cryptocurrency market, coinciding with a 5% drop in the token's price. 

 Blockchain data reveals that the massive transfer took place recently, marking one of the largest movements of SHIB tokens in recent times. Whale Alert states, ""2,200,000,000,000 SHIB worth $39,945,400 was transferred from Robinhood to unknown wallet.""

 The transfer has coincided with a noticeable 5% decline in SHIB’s price. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu was down 4.79% in the last 24 hours to $0.00001779, mirroring the broader downturn in the crypto market. 

 However, there is no direct correlation between the transfer and the price drop, as withdrawals from the exchange might signal an intent to buy. 

 Amid this, the SHIB community has been abuzz with speculation, trying to understand the reasons behind this significant transfer. A whale might transfer assets to a cold wallet for security purposes. It could also be a strategy to consolidate holdings ahead of a market recovery. On the other hand, it could imply a strategic accumulation by a major player on the market, potentially setting the stage for a future price rally. 

 However, a closer look at the transaction utilizing data from Etherscan suggests that the move might be due to funds reshuffling as the recipient wallet turned out to be a Robinhood-named account. The said wallet has had interactions with Robinhood addresses in the past, suggesting an affiliation. 

 As the market experiences a moment of uncertainty, all eyes are on where the SHIB price trends next, with a concentration on the range between $0.000017 and $0.000019, where it currently trades with 416.19 trillion SHIB bought around here.

newsbtc:25470f25b094b:0,XRP Faces Extended Bearish Pressure At $0.4937 Amid Market Weakness,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 11:00:23 GMT",NewsBTC,"XRP, one of the leading cryptocurrencies, is currently grappling with extended bearish pressure amid prevailing market weakness. The digital asset has been facing significant downward momentum, influenced by a confluence of factors including macroeconomic uncertainties, regulatory challenges, and broader market sentiment.  

 Thus far, XRP’s price has struggled to maintain key support levels, exacerbating concerns among traders and investors about its near-term performance. As bearish momentum continues to dominate, this analysis delves into evaluating XRP’s current market position with the help of key technical indicators focusing on the 4-hour and the 1-day chart. 

 The price of XRP has increased by 0.63%, trading at about $0.4920 in the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of more than $27 billion and a trading volume of more than $1 billion as of the time of writing. There has been a 1.06% decrease in market capitalization in the last day despite the trading volume being up by 5.89%. 

 XRP Current Market Performance And Trend 

 Currently, the price of XRP is actively bearish trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the 4-hour timeframe, and the price here is beginning to decline after a failed upward attempt. With the current price formation, it can be suggested that XRP’s bearish trend may likely extend. 

 Also, the Composite Trend Oscillator confirms that XRP’s decline may be extended as both the signal line and the SMA of the indicator are descending from the overbought section toward the zero line. 

 In the 1-day chart, XRP is trading below the 100-day SMA attempting to move upward. It should be noted that this is just a short-term move as the crypto asset’s price at some point will begin to drop again thereby extending the bearish trend. 

 Additionally, the formation of the 1-day Composite Trend Oscillator indicates that XRP’s bearish trend may likely extend as both the signal line and the SMA of the indicator are trending below the zero line closed to the oversold zone. 

 Navigating The Bearish Market For The Token 

 With XRP currently facing significant bearish pressure, It should be noted that if the crypto asset continues bearish as predicted, it will begin to move towards the $0.4663 support level. If it breaks below this level, it will decline further to test the $0.4088 support level and may move to test the $0.3483 support level if it breaches the $0.4088 level.  

 However, if XRP fails to decline further and decides to move upward, it will begin to move toward the $0.5725 resistance level. Once this level is breached, XRP’s price will continue upward to challenge the $0.6697 resistance level and may move on to test other resistance levels above.

cointelegraph:0de9cbdba094b:0,Bitcoin reclaims blockchain dominance post-BTC halving,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 10:19:10 GMT",Cointelegraph,"Bitcoin’s blockchain bandwidth usage has exceeded 90% for the first time since the halving event in April, signaling a substantial rise in network activity. 

 Despite facing an ‘extended level’ of Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD), Bitcoin adoption, transaction and trading activity remain unfettered.  

 Dune Analytics user Cryptokoryo’s chart portrays the defining moment on June 20, where BTC’s 91.4% dominance superseded 6.8% for Runes, 1.6% for BRC-20, and 0.2% for Ordinals in transactional share.Cointelegraph 

 Always Rune for improvement  

 The increase in bandwidth usage after the halving can be primarily attributed to the adoption of new token standards, including Runes and BRC-20. 

 Dune Analytics data shows a significant rise in transactions involving both token standards, particularly on April 23, when Runes transactions exceeded 750,000.Cointelegraph 

 New token standards 

 Speaking with Cointelegraph, Bitfinex analysts explained that: 

 Runes were designed to establish fungible tokens on the BTC blockchain and gained widespread traction, resulting in high transaction volume. Cointelegraph 

 Paired with the adoption of BRC-20 tokens, this rise of more complex transactions and BTC blockchain interaction significantly increased the chain’s bandwidth load. 

 Post-halving impact 

 The recent April BTC halving event, which reduced block rewards for miners by 50%, led to miners prioritizing transactions with higher fees to compensate the reduction in rewards. 

 On the topic of the halving event’s impact on the BTC blockchain, Bitfinex analysts told Cointelegraph: 

 The typical pattern resulted in an increased number of transactions being processed and gave momentum to the steady surge in BTC's blockchain bandwidth usage.

u_today:dd78ff8d6094b:0,USDT on Toncoin (TON) Officially Goes Live on Binance: Details,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 10:17:00 GMT",U.Today,"Binance just announced that it has now integrated Tether USDTUSD on the Toncoin (TON) network. Users can start depositing and withdrawing using the Telegram-associated blockchain.  

 On April 19, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino and Telegram CEO Pavel Durov issued a joint statement at the TOKEN2049 conference, announcing the issuance of USDT on TON. Since then, USDT's offer on TON has already exceeded the equivalent of $580 million. This positions TON as the sixth largest blockchain in terms of USDT on it, when the top three are TRON, Ethereum and Solana.

 In addition, Tether and TON announced that they are going to launch more than 100 integrations with partners around the world to boost adoption of both the popular stablecoin and the blockchain associated with Telegram.  

 When Toncoin listing? 

 Interestingly, however, Toncoin itself — the native token of the TON blockchain — still has no spot listing on Binance. At the moment, the ninth largest cryptocurrency on the world's largest crypto exchange is represented only in the form of perpetual futures. 

 As it stands, Binance has Toncoin on the derivatives market, allows USDT transfers on the TON network and has listed Notcoin (NOT) — one of the major sensations in the ecosystem, but is yet to list TON on the spot market. What's the catch? 

 Stay tuned for the latest updates on Toncoin's market availability and the broader implications of USDT's integration on the TON blockchain.

u_today:2cdad0c94094b:0,Bitcoin ETF Capital Drain Deepens With $139 Million Outflow,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 10:12:00 GMT",U.Today,"The spot Bitcoin ETF ecosystem has continued to lose capital in what is a sustained bearish trend for the asset class. It remains unclear why Wall Street has continued to capitulate on its once aggressive Bitcoin ETF embrace, but the current disposition has triggered a sustained drawdown in the price of Bitcoin. 

 Per data from SoSoValue, a total of $139.98 million left spot Bitcoin ETFs on June 20. Grayscale Investments’ GBTC turned out to be the biggest loser, with a total outflow of $53 million. Fidelity Investments came second, with investors pulling out $51 million. 

 Bitwise (BITB) also saw a total outflow of $32 million, while VanEck recorded $4 million in capital drain relative to its size. Invesco Galaxy Digital's offering saw a total of $2 million. 

 Not all the spot Bitcoin ETF products recorded outflows as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) broke the trend. The product recorded a daily volume of $565 million, while the net inflow came in at $1 million. There is a very thin line between Bitcoin ETF inflows and outflows, and from current market data, the products in question all showcased some form of an uptick in trading volume. 

 Over the past week, spot Bitcoin ETF products have recorded a net outflow of $900 million as June 20 marked the fifth straight day of outflows. This marks the product’s worst performance since mid-April, shortly after the short inflow stint mid-month. 

 The impact of these bearish Bitcoin ETF trends has also trickled down to the lackluster performance of BTC. Over the past 24 hours, the price of the coin has dropped by 2.8%, and it is trading at $63,784.68. Bitcoin’s trading volume is up 33.93% to $25,990,936,338, shining a light of confidence. 

 With this rebooted sentiment and hopes for a rebound on the spot Bitcoin ETF market, the price of the coin might reroute its trend in the short term.

beincrypto:e94862987094b:0,Avalanche (AVAX) Price Eyes $30 Retest Following 12% Decline,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 10:11:59 GMT",Beincrypto,"Three days ago, BeInCrypto reported that bears planned to push the Avalanche AVAXUSD price to $25. While the token’s price fell in that direction, recent data suggests it may soon rebound. 

 The cryptocurrency’s value has fallen by 12.31% in the last seven days while trading at $27.72. Here are the potential targets for the coming days. 

 Avalanche Holders Plan to HODL 

 Firstly, we analyzed the Addresses by Time Held, as provided by IntoTheBlock. 

 As of this writing, the number of Cruisers, also called swing traders, decreased in the last 30 days. Short-term speculators also towed a similar path. 

 However, addresses holding AVAX for at least a year increased by 16.12% within the same period. Historically, when the number of holders decreases, it means that the bull market is reaching its last stages. 

 Past cycles, including 2013, 2017, and 2021, show evidence of this. However, an increase in the number of Avalanche holders when the price of a cryptocurrency has gone through a correction is a bullish sign. 

 Furthermore, if sustained, AVAX may begin to take steps to erase some of its losses. The addresses by holdings also show evidence of a possible price increase. 

 At press time, the number of addresses holding 100,000 to 10 million AVAX increased. An increasing number of holders with large amounts of tokens is a positive sign of the price. As such, AVAX may resist further downside and begin to climb. 

 AVAX Price Prediction: Challenges Appear Despite Bullish Potential 

 As seen below, Avalanche’s price has bounced after falling to $26.47 earlier. While it remains sandwiched below $30, bulls seem ready to curb the tenacious downswing. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows proof of this attempt. 

 On June 18, AVAX dropped to the oversold region. But at 32.07, the RSI reveals that little drops of buying pressure are starting to appear. If bulls sustain this momentum, AVAX’s price may jump to $30.95. In a highly bullish scenario, the token’s value can reach $33.20. 

 However, the Ichimoku Cloud indicator shows that AVAX may experience a stumbling block in the attempt. If this happens, the bullish price prediction will be invalidated. 

 Ichimoku Cloud: It consists of five moving averages, which help to identify the trend direction. As a result, it spots resistance and support regions. 

 If the price denoted by the candles moves about the cloud, it is an uptrend. But if the cloud is above the price, it is a downtrend. Looking at the AVAX/USD daily chart above, we observe that the cloud was below the price in March. 

 Consequently, this drove AVAX to $60.66 at that time. However, as of this writing, it is the other way around. By the look of things, AVAX’s price can increase. However, if buying pressure is not intense, it may not surpass $31.98. This may force a rejection to $26.60

the_block:82f64284b094b:0,Arbitrum’s daily revenue soared to record $3.4 million amid LayerZero token claims,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 09:56:59 GMT",The Block,"Ethereum Layer 2 network Arbitrum saw daily revenue soar to a record $3.4 million (in ETH) on Thursday, benefiting from increased activity related to the opening of LayerZero’s ZRO token claims, for which it was the coordination chain. 

 Arbitrum had witnessed just $20,000 in revenue on June 19. This shows the daily revenue spiked more than 16,500% on Thursday in comparison, according to a Dune dashboard aggregated by datawarlock. 

 “One of the biggest winners from the LayerZero airdrop — Arbitrum,” Austin Marrazza, product manager at Arbitrum developer Offchain Labs, said. “DAO raked in $3 million in congestion fees from claiming traffic today.” 

 Arbitrum revenue. Image: Dune Analytics. 

 The LayerZero Foundation, the organization that supports the cross-chain interoperability platform LayerZero, opened airdrop claims for its native ZRO token at 7 a.m. ET on Thursday, which will remain open until Sept. 20. 

 Some 85 million ZRO tokens, representing 8.5% of the 1 billion total supply, are claimable by eligible participants, with the remaining tokens reserved for future distribution programs, ecosystem growth, strategic partners and core contributors. LayerZero Labs CEO Bryan Pellegrino previously identified a total of 1.28 million wallets eligible for the airdrop. 

 LayerZero asks eligible users to pay 10 cents per ZRO to claim airdrop 

 However, the foundation subsequently announced that to claim ZRO, users must make a $0.10 donation per ZRO token in USDC, USDT or ETH to support Protocol Guild, a non-profit funding collective for Ethereum core researchers and developers. 

 The new ""Proof-of-Donation"" claims mechanism is designed to generate up to $18.5 million for Protocol Guild, with LayerZero Foundation matching donations up to $10 million and the donated funds vested over four years. 

 The new claim mechanism faced criticism from some in the crypto community, who view the mandatory donations as a disguised form of funding or a tax rather than a true airdrop — typically intended as a reward for user contributions and to decentralize the protocol. 

 ""There is no forced donation, if you don't want to donate... simply don't claim. This is not something you own, it's something being offered,"" Pellegrino responded on Thursday. 

 Arbitrum fees spike 

 Arbitrum benefitted as it is used as the coordination chain for the LayerZero token claims contract, processing claims atomically without needing additional LayerZero messaging. 

 Eligible users can also claim ZRO from Ethereum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, BNB Chain and Avalanche, but this requires a LayerZero cross-chain message to facilitate the claim on these networks.  

 As a result, median gas prices on Arbitrum spiked from 0.01 gwei to 34.7 gwei before falling back to similar levels as the activity subsided.

 The jump in gas price equated to average daily transaction fees on Arbitrum soaring to $0.89 on Thursday, compared to a sub-cent typical fee. They have since returned to that baseline. 

 LayerZero’s ZRO token is currently trading for $3.15, according to CoinGecko data. It has a market cap of $796 million and a fully diluted valuation of $3.2 billion, with nearly $1 billion in trading volume over the past 24 hours.

cointelegraph:d7631567c094b:0,How to long and short with margin trading,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 09:56:00 GMT",Cointelegraph,"Crypto margin trading allows traders to borrow funds (called leverage) to increase their trading positions. Understanding how crypto margin trading works with long and short positions is essential for maximizing potential profits.  

 This article explains what crypto margin trading is, how it works with long and short positions and what exchanges support it. 

 What are long and short positions? 

 A long position, or going long, is a strategy in which a trader or investor purchases an asset, such as stocks or cryptocurrencies, believing its price will increase. Long positions can benefit investors since they can purchase assets at a lower price and sell them at a higher price, thus profiting from the difference between the two. This strategy is based on a favorable market and an expected asset value increase. 

 A short position, or short-selling strategy, aims to profit from asset price declines. In this strategy, an investor sells borrowed cryptocurrencies or shares, intending to repurchase them at a lower price to return them to the lender. The profit is the difference between an asset’s selling price and the cost of buying it back. This strategy depends on negative outlooks and the bet that the asset’s price will fall. 

 Even though both positions seek to profit from market movements, the fundamental difference lies in their approaches. Both have unique risk profiles and reward characteristics appropriate for different market environments and investor expectations. 

 Mechanics of margin trading 

 Margin trading is a high-risk, high-reward strategy where investors borrow funds from a brokerage to buy more assets than they could with their capital alone. This strategy, facilitated by leverage, amplifies both profits and losses.  

 While standard trading entails using the investor’s own capital, margin trading involves using borrowed funds. These funds are subject to margin requirements, which specify the minimum amount of equity that an investor should maintain in their account. 

 The mechanics of margin trading involve using collateral assets, such as cryptocurrencies, to secure the borrowed funds. Typically, to prevent a margin call, in which the brokerage may either request additional funds or liquidate assets to cover losses, investors must maintain a specific level of collateral relative to the borrowed amount. This level is known as the maintenance margin, which ensures that investors have enough funds to cover potential losses. 

 Although margin trading provides an opportunity to increase profits, it also amplifies the risks associated with the strategy, particularly in volatile markets. Traders should remember that effectively executing margin trading requires a deep comprehension of risk management techniques and market dynamics. 

 How to identify margin trading opportunities 

 Margin trading is a complex process that demands vigilance and alertness to identify the best conditions to short or long. To pinpoint entry and exit positions, traders should utilize technical analysis tools such as momentum indicators, moving averages and levels of support and resistance. Additionally, changes in investor behavior can be detected by monitoring market sentiment through news sources, social media and analyst reports. 

 For shorting opportunities, future margin traders — those trading in derivatives — can search for overvalued assets with weakening fundamentals or technical indicators pointing to a possible downturn. They should also watch out for macroeconomic factors that could negatively affect markets, such as shifts in interest rates or geopolitical tensions. 

 Conversely, traders can identify long-term prospects by locating affordable assets with growth potential. Some valuable steps include examining business earnings reports, market trends and potential disruptors that could impact market prices. 

 How to long and short with margin trading  

 Margin trading can be done on various platforms, including cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, Kraken or Bitfinex, brokers like Interactive Brokers, derivative platforms like BitMEX, or even decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols such as Aave.  

 Below is a comprehensive guide that covers the fundamentals of margin trading and shows how to utilize these platforms for long- and short-selling cryptocurrencies. 

 How to long crypto with margin trading 

 Step 1: Select a platform 

 To start margin trading, choose a reputable cryptocurrency exchange, broker, derivative platform or DeFi protocol that offers margin trading services. 

 Step 2: Create an account 

 Create an account on the preferred platform and perform the required identity verification steps. Certain platforms require extra steps, such as taking a quiz or going through the Know Your Customer (KYC) process, to enable margin cryptocurrency trading.  

 If utilizing a DeFi protocol for margin trading, link the account to a crypto wallet before depositing funds. Then, deposit money into the account and ensure that you have enough funds to fulfill the trade’s initial margin requirements. 

 Step 3: Choose account type 

 Platforms usually offer two types of margin trading — cross-margin and isolated margin. In isolated margin trading, specific funds can be allocated to each trade, lowering the risk of liquidation, whereas in cross-margin trading, the entire account balance serves as collateral for all open positions.Cointelegraph 

 Step 4: Provide collateral 

 Before placing a margin trade, ensure that collateral is deposited into the margin account. Depending on the platform being used, the collateral can be cryptocurrency, stablecoins or fiat currency. The quantity of collateral depends on the selected leverage and the margin requirements of the exchange. 

 Select a leverage level appropriate for your risk-taking ability and trading plan. Some commonly used leverage ratios include 2x, 5x and 10x. 

 Step 5: Place a long order 

 After the collateral has been posted and the leverage ratio has been chosen, a long position in the cryptocurrency can be initiated. Enter the quantity and other specifications and finalize the order. 

 Step 6: Repay the loan and withdraw profits 

 To exit a long position, sell the cryptocurrency to return the borrowed amount and the accumulated interest. If the trade is profitable and the asset is sold at a higher price, earnings can be transferred to the associated bank account or a crypto wallet. 

 How to short crypto with margin trading  

 Step 1: Select a platform 

 When delving into margin trading to short cryptocurrencies, select a reliable platform offering margin trading services. 

 Step 2: Create an account 

 Set up an account on the chosen platform and complete the identity verification process. Some platforms require completing additional tasks to enable margin trading features. 

 If using a DeFi protocol, connect a cryptocurrency wallet to the account. Ensure that the account is funded to meet the initial margin requirements for the short trades. 

 Step 3: Choose account type  

 Platforms typically offer two types of margin trading: cross-margin and isolated margin. Select the one that aligns with the trading objectives. 

 Step 4: Provide collateral  

 Before initiating a short trade, deposit the necessary collateral into the margin account. Depending on the platform, different collateral types, such as stablecoins or cryptocurrencies, can be required. The chosen leverage level and the platform’s margin requirements dictate how much collateral is required. Select a leverage ratio that aligns with your risk tolerance and trading strategy.  

 Step 5: Place the short order  

 Once the collateral is deposited and leverage is determined, initiate a short position in the chosen cryptocurrency. Once the quantity and other specifications have been specified, place the short order. 

 Step 6: Repay the loan and collect profits  

 To close the short position, buy back the cryptocurrency at a cheaper price to repay the borrowed amount and any accrued interest. If the short trade is profitable, withdraw the earnings to the linked bank account or crypto wallet.Cointelegraph 

 Key considerations: Fees and costs for margin trading  

 Like any other transaction, shorting crypto usually comes with costs and fees varying from platform to platform. 

 On cryptocurrency exchanges, trading costs are associated with each transaction. Most cryptocurrency exchanges divide these costs into maker and taker fees. Maker fees are charged when a user provides liquidity with limit orders, while taker fees are charged when a user removes liquidity by completing existing orders. 

 Shorting or longing on margin trading platforms can also be costly due to the margin fees involved. These fees usually range at a variable daily rate, adjusted daily based on market conditions. 

 Some platforms charge additional fees after the trade has been executed. One common fee is a withdrawal fee, which is charged every time cryptocurrency is withdrawn from the platform.  

 DeFi protocols take swap fees from liquidity providers, gas fees for executing blockchain transactions and borrowing fees from fluctuating interest rates for margin trading. Most crypto brokers profit through the spread, which is the difference between the buying and selling price or through commission per trade. 

 How is crypto margin trading taxed? 

 Profits from shorting and longing crypto through margin trading are usually subject to capital gains tax. The exact tax rate and reporting procedure may vary depending on the holding period and the jurisdiction, with short-term gains usually subject to a higher rate than long-term ones. 

 Furthermore, these losses from such trades may be utilized to offset other capital gains and, therefore, may help minimize the tax burden. 

 How is forced liquidation in margin trading taxed? 

 Capital gains tax may also apply to any gains or losses that result from forced liquidation during margin trading. Forced liquidation is the process during which a broker sells assets to cover the margin when the value of the assets used as collateral for a trade drops below a certain level. 

 Are margin calls taxed? 

 Typically, margin calls are not subject to taxes. Since a margin call is essentially a request for additional collateral, it doesn’t result in a taxable event until a trade or sale occurs. However, any profits or losses from the sale of cryptocurrencies in response to a margin call would be subject to capital gains tax. 

 Risk management in margin trading 

 Risk management, as well as entry and exit strategies, are essential in margin trading, especially when dealing with volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. To reduce risks when short-selling, identify key resistance levels and set stop-loss orders slightly above them to limit losses. Stop-loss orders can be placed below support levels for long positions to protect capital. 

 Monitoring margin levels can help avoid margin calls when an account’s equity drops below required levels. Understanding liquidation prices ensures positions are closed before losses escalate.

cointelegraph:bb526418c094b:0,Fantom allocates $120M in FTM tokens for Sonic migration,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 09:46:31 GMT",Cointelegraph,"The Fantom Foundation, the organization behind the Fantom platform, has announced a financial commitment to support the launch of Sonic, a new ultra-fast network.  

 On June 20, the Fantom Foundation announced that it is committing up to 200 million Fantom FTMUSD tokens worth about $120 million to help developers and companies move their projects to Sonic as part of the Sonic Labs Innovator Fund. 

 About the funds 

 The funds will be used to find and secure partners who can help build and grow the Sonic network. These partners include developers creating apps directly on Fantom, developers making decentralized applications (DApps) and partners providing crucial tools and services.Cointelegraph 

 Fantom’s announcement attributes the accumulation of the FTM tokens to Andre Cronje’s treasury management.  

 The allocations will initially focus on providing strategic grants to applications already within the Fantom ecosystem, with priority given to those who have demonstrated a strong interest in utilizing Sonic technology. 

 Sonic Foundation 

 This development follows the creation of a new foundation to facilitate the launch of the Sonic Chain. Fantom’s Sonic Foundation will oversee Sonic’s governance, manage the network treasury, orchestrate partnerships and develop the DApp ecosystem.

From meme coins capturing the public’s imagination and then facing abrupt corrections to Bitcoin’s BTCUSD role as a safe haven in global finance, the crypto market remains a complex and exciting arena. 

  Adding to the allure of the crypto market, mainstream personalities such as Andrew Tate have joined the meme coin bandwagon. Moreover, there are claims that former US President Donald Trump has released his own meme coin. Meanwhile, the experts highlight the risks with altcoin investment, as they lag despite the Bitcoin rally. 

 Andrew Tate’s DADDY Meme Coin Plummets 60%  

 This week, Andrew Tate’s venture into the meme coin market, Daddy Tate (DADDY), witnessed a steep 65% decline. Despite Tate’s ambitious strategies to increase its utility—including transforming it into a non-fungible token NFTUSDT and integrating it with his Real World University—the coin failed to inspire investor confidence. 

 “I want to reduce the supply of the DADDY coin, so even if you hold one DADDY coin, you get karmic benefits from the universe. I will do that by buying the coin with my own money and burning it at certain market caps. It will have such a limited supply that it becomes a badge of honor to own any at all,” Tate stated. 

 Even with Tate’s commitment to purchasing and burning coins to boost market value, the meme coin struggles amid controversies and a volatile market. It has dropped over 70% from its peak. 

 Bitcoin as Safe Haven: BlackRock CEO Highlights Economic Shift 

 At a recent G7 summit, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink emphasized the pivotal change in global financial systems. Capital markets have overtaken banks as the main sources of private-sector financing. 

 Consequently, Bitcoin has emerged as a potential safe haven. Analysts note its low correlation with equities and significant institutional interest as factors boosting its safe-haven status. With the US launching spot Bitcoin ETFs attracting $15 billion since January, Bitcoin continues to draw attention as a reliable asset during economic uncertainties. 

 “I believe the role of Bitcoin and the digital assets space will become increasingly significant each year,” Matteo Greco, Research Analyst at Fineqia, told BeInCrypto. 

 Donald Trump’s DJT Meme Coin Saga Unfolds 

 This week, the DJT meme coin, allegedly linked to Donald Trump and his son Barron, captured the crypto community’s attention after soaring 1,450% due to speculative posts. However, the coin later plummeted nearly 75% amid the unfolding drama. 

 Martin Shkreli, a controversial figure, claimed to have helped develop DJT, asserting involvement from the Trump family, though this remains unverified. 

 “Barron told me his dad was in on it. His dad liked it,” Shkreli stated. 

 However, Trump advisor Roger Stone has categorically denied any Trump family involvement. Meanwhile, other political personalities like New York legislator Ben Geller have contrasted Stone’s claims. 

 “I believe from reputable sources that Barron was [involved], then backed away once things were absolutely destroyed by the developer. This was a PR disaster,” Geller said. 

 Analyst Warns Against Altcoin Investments 

 Crypto analysts are increasingly skeptical about altcoins’ prospects. Quinn Thompson of Lekker Capital points to market instability and high leverage as indicators of potential risks. The significant capital inflows into Bitcoin ETFs contrast sharply with the struggling altcoin market. 

 New altcoins face intense selling pressure due to oversupply and diminished demand. Experts suggest that altcoins are facing a tougher environment, potentially reducing their investment appeal. 

 “Altcoins have a constant stream of sell pressure. As we enter an already low-volume summer period, the combination of significant token supply unlocks and venture capitalists’ sell pressure will likely be too strong of an uphill battle for most tokens,” Thompson said. 

 Since March, the total crypto market capitalization, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum ETHUSD, has decreased by 22.42%. This means that all the other crypto, except Bitcoin and Ethereum, are struggling. 

 Financial Advisors Remain Cautious on Bitcoin ETFs 

 Despite the growing popularity of Bitcoin ETFs among self-directed investors, financial advisors are treading carefully. BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer of ETF, Samara Cohen, highlighted that advisors are meticulously analyzing the risks associated with Bitcoin’s price volatility. 

 With a cautious approach, advisors prioritize their fiduciary duties over the high-risk, high-reward allure of Bitcoin investments. Despite optimistic forecasts about Bitcoin’s potential, the careful stance of professional advisors highlights the challenges of integrating cryptocurrencies into traditional investment portfolios. 

 Meanwhile, this week, the spot Bitcoin ETFs are struggling. So far, they have recorded an outflow of over $438 million.

 This Week’s Crypto Top 10 

 The crypto market continues its downward trend this week, with the total market capitalization dipping to $2.35 trillion. Notably, Bitcoin and Ethereum saw declines of 3.48% and 0.15%, respectively. 

 Dogecoin DOGEUSD and Solana SOLUSD faced the steepest drops among the top ten cryptocurrencies. However, XRP bucked the trend with a 2.67% increase, showcasing its resilience amidst market volatility.

cointelegraph:b3e7e3585094b:0,Marathon’s BTC mining is heating an entire town in Finland ,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 09:40:45 GMT",Cointelegraph,"Bitcoin mining is warming an entire town in Finland thanks to a new project by the world’s largest Bitcoin mining company. 

 Marathon Digital Holdings has launched a pilot project that uses the recycled heat from Bitcoin BTCUSD mining to warm the houses of over 11,000 residents. 

 The 2-megawatt pilot project, located in the Satakunte region, was announced in a June 20 X post: 

 Cointelegraph 

 The Finland-based facility marks Marathon’s first district heating-based pilot project in the Euro area. 

 Bitcoin mining: the future’s renewable source of heating? 

 Marathon’s new facility uses a method called ‘district heating’ which centrally heats the water and distributes it through an underground network of pipes to heat houses. 

 This could prove to be a future-proof method for heating homes since Bitcoin mining rigs produce a significant amount of excess heat. 

 Marathon is the world’s largest Bitcoin mining firm worth over $5.84 billion, which is 33% more compared to the second-largest company, CleanSpark’s $4.36 billion market capitalization, according to CompaniesMarketCap data.Cointelegraph 

 On a smaller scale, some companies are already working on Bitcoin mining-based local heating units for homes. Some of the most popular solutions include Heatbit, which is marketed as a “plug-and-play” heating and air purifying machine, that mines Bitcoin at 10 TH/s.Cointelegraph 

 Is heating the new revenue stream for BTC miners? 

 Bitcoin miners are looking for ways to increase their revenue after the 2024 Bitcoin halving cut block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. 

 Marathon has long been exploring other ways to monetize the heat generated from its Bitcoin mining facilities and data centers, the video announcement explained: 

 Selling the excess heat from Bitcoin mining could come as a significant financial lifeline for Marathon, which already operates over 11 mining sites worldwide, and controls 4.8% of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate, according to its homepage.Cointelegraph 

 Cointelegraph has approached Marathon Digital for comment.

newsbtc:7c46a52d1094b:0,"Follow The Whales? Arthur Hayes Buys Pendle, Token Soars 25%","Fri, 21 Jun 2024 09:30:18 GMT",NewsBTC,"Pendle (PENDLE), a cryptocurrency powering a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has experienced a price surge in recent days. This rally comes amidst positive developments within the Pendle ecosystem and a high-profile investment from industry veteran Arthur Hayes. However, concerns regarding token distribution threaten to cast a shadow over Pendle’s long-term prospects. 

 Hayes Fuels The Fire: Crypto Whale Ignites Investor Confidence 

 The recent price surge can be partly attributed to a strategic move by Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and a prominent figure in the crypto space. 

 Pendle tallied a 25% increase from its lowest point this week to an intraday peak of $6.21, after Hayes publicly announced his acquisition of Pendle tokens, a move interpreted by many as a sign of confidence in the project. 

 After Arthur Hayes(@CryptoHayes) tweeted that he is adding $PENDLE and $DOGE to his bags, one of his wallets bought 92,339.6 $PENDLE($554K) through #Wintermute. 

 He transferred 2.05M $USDC to #Wintermute, then received 280 $ETH($1M) and 92,339.6 $PENDLE($554K).… pic.twitter.com/wo2Sl4245B 

 This endorsement from a seasoned investor with a successful track record, like Hayes’ involvement with the fast-growing USDe stablecoin, has undoubtedly bolstered investor sentiment towards Pendle. 

 NewsBTC 

 Pendle’s Ecosystem Takes Flight: TVL Skyrockets, User Base Expands 

 Beyond Hayes’ influence, Pendle’s own internal developments are driving the current momentum. The project’s total value locked (TVL), a key metric reflecting the total value of crypto assets deposited within the protocol, has witnessed a significant uptick. 

 The surge in TVL suggests that more and more people are using Pendle’s DeFi features. These features let users earn impressive yields on their crypto holdings, with some reaching as high as 25%. 

 That’s significantly better than what most users get from traditional investments like short-term US Treasuries. On top of that, the number of Pendle token holders keeps climbing, which shows a growing and active user base for the protocol. 

 A Cloud On The Horizon: Token Distribution Raises Concerns 

 While the current outlook for Pendle appears promising, a potential hurdle lies in the project’s tokenomics: a small number of addresses control a substantial portion of Pendle’s circulating supply. 

 This concentrated ownership structure could lead to market manipulation in the future. Furthermore, the planned release of additional tokens into circulation raises concerns about potential dilution of existing token value.Balancing Growth With Sustainability 

 Pendle’s recent price surge and positive ecosystem developments paint a rosy picture, but the token distribution model presents a significant challenge. Moving forward, the token’s success will hinge on its ability to foster sustainable growth while addressing concerns regarding tokenomics. 

 Expanding the user base and diversifying token ownership will be crucial steps in securing Pendle’s long-term future.

beincrypto:4a8b260cb094b:0,Top 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Altcoins for the Third Week of June 2024,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 09:18:10 GMT",Beincrypto,"So far, the week has been interesting for artificial intelligence and big data crypto projects and tokens. Fueled by Nvidia (NVDA) surpassing Microsoft (MSFT) to become the world’s most valuable company, some of these assets have experienced double-digit price rallies over the past week. 

 During the period in consideration, HashAI (HASHAI), Turbo (TURBO), and 0x0.ai (0x0) are the AI-based tokens with the most gains.  

 HashAI (HASHAI) Forms an Ascending Channel 

 HASHAI is the native token of HashAI, a crypto project that uses artificial intelligence to optimize cryptocurrency mining. Exchanging hands at $0.0010 at press time, the altcoin’s value has surged by 18% in the last seven days. 

 The price hike comes after the token plummeted to an all-time low of $0.00075 on June 14. However, as the demand for the altcoin climbed, its price has since grown by 36%. 

 Assessed on a one-day chart, HASHAI’s price has formed an ascending channel. This is a bullish signal, as this channel is formed when an asset’s price makes a series of higher highs and higher lows, thereby creating an uptrend.  

 Confirming the spike in its buying pressure in the past few days, HASHAI’s price is poised to cross above its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This key moving average measures the token’s average price over the past 20 days.  

 Its price rally towards the 20-day EMA indicates that buying pressure for HASHAI among market participants exceeds the selling momentum. 

 If the demand for the AI coin continues to grow, it might rally to exchange hands at $0.0064 and head toward the upper line of the ascending channel, which currently forms resistance.  

 Turbo (TURBO) Charges to New Highs 

 Referred to as the first-ever memecoin created by AI, Turbo’s (TURBO) price has risen by 15% in the past seven days.  

 Last week’s rally forms an extension of the month-long rally in TURBO’s price. At press time, the altcoin trades hands at $0.0054. In the last month, its price has skyrocketed by 317%.  

 Confirming the bullish bias towards the token, readings from its Directional Movement Index (DMI) show its positive index (blue) at 30.21 above its negative index (orange) at 19.35.  

 An asset’s DMI measures its market trend and gauges its strength. When the positive index lies above the negative index, it suggests that price growth is strong. Traders often interpret this as a signal to consider entering or holding onto long positions. 

 If the demand for TURBO is maintained, its price may rally to $0.0060. 

 However, if profit-taking activity commences, this projection will be invalidated, and the token’s price may fall to $0.0053. 

 0x0.ai (0x0) Secures Gains for Its Holders 

 Housed on the Ethereum network, 0x0.ai uses AI to provide its users with a high degree of privacy for their transactions. Its native token, 0x0, has seen its value climb by 11% in the last seven days.  

 This rally comes after an extended period of decline in the altcoin’s value. On June 18, 0x0 closed a four-month low of $0.19.  

 However, the AI token initiated an uptrend as market sentiment shifted from bearish to bullish. As of this writing, 0x0 exchanges hands at 0.24. 

 According to the altcoin’s Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) indicator, its MACD line (blue) has crossed above its signal line (orange) and is in an uptrend towards the zero line. 

 An asset’s MACD indicator tracks its price trends and momentum. When set up this way, the shorter-term moving average accelerates faster than the longer-term moving average. This is a bullish signal that traders interpret as a sign to take long positions. 

 If this bullish trend continues, 0x0 might be sold at $0.26 per token.

u_today:d6130a486094b:0,SHIB on Verge of Breakout? Here's What Shiba Inu Insider Says,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 08:55:00 GMT",U.Today,"In a recent tweet, the Shiba Inu team’s marketing lead, Lucie, addressed the SHIB army as she was pondering whether the SHIB meme coin is about to enter the “optimism,” stage, which promises a major price surge. 

 The next stages after “optimism” are “belief,” “thrill” and “euphoria,” with price jumps even higher. 

 SHIB executive hints at possible surge soon 

 Lucie published a screenshot of the “Wall Street Cheat Sheet,” which shows all the psychological stages of a market cycle reached by assets, with all the ups and downs – disbelief, hope, optimism, belief, complacency, anxiety, denial and several others. 

 Before optimism?  

 Yes or no? $SHIB pic.twitter.com/X0nqwnFqQN— 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 | SHIB.IO (@LucieSHIB) June 20, 2024 

 Lucie believes that Shiba Inu might be about to enter the “optimism” stage, which is characterized by a notable price increase. This step on the diagram is described as, “This rally is real.” 

 “Optimism” is followed by “belief” (“Time to get fully invested,” the diagram says), then comes “thrill” (“I will buy more on margin. Gotta tell everyone to buy!”), and “euphoria” (accompanied by slogans: “I’m a genius! We’re all going to be rich!”). 

 SHIB price action 

 The reaction of the SHIB army to that statement was mixed, with many optimistically agreeing with Lucie and expecting a price increase soon. However, many SHIB fans in the comments also expressed their doubt and uncertainty about Lucie’s assumptions. 

 After the massive 11% decline that SHIB saw on Tuesday (with a large red hourly candle), the second largest meme cryptocurrency has been trading sideways, moving in a range between the $0.00001772 support and the $0.00001891 resistance, striving to break through the latter. 

 SHIB burns soar 530% 

 Meanwhile, a major Shiba Inu metric, the burn rate, has demonstrated an impressive 530% increase over the past 24 hours. Thus, a total of 37,534,163 meme coins were transferred to unspendable blockchain addresses. 

 Out of 13 transactions, six were made from the same -d3e43 wallet, as it burned 15.8 million SHIB. The largest transaction, made by another wallet, carried 10,027,548 SHIB. 

 So far, 410,727,009,502,240 SHIB from the total circulating supply have been burned already. However, the 410 trillion SHIB were burned by Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin in 2021. The rest has been burned since the start of 2022 by the joint forces of the community and the SHIB team.

 On June 19, the FCA said the illegal business was believed to have bought and sold more than 1 billion British pounds ($1.2 billion) worth of unregistered crypto assets. During raids of offices associated with the suspects, the FCA seized multiple digital devices.  

 FCA compliance 

 Therese Chambers, the executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said that the regulator plays an “important role” in keeping “dirty money out of the U.K. financial system.” 

 The FCA interviewed the two suspects who were arrested and released on bail, though the investigation is ongoing.  

 In the U.K., crypto asset exchange operators must register with the FCA directly and comply with money laundering regulations to ensure legal operations. This has been the case since January 2021.  

 Charlotte Tregunna, a crypto fraud expert and partner at the business crime law firm Peters & Peters, said that given that these exchange requirements have been active for so long, it would be “difficult to persuade the FCA” that it is unaware of any requirements.

u_today:1ce18ced2094b:0,XRP Co-Creator Reacts to Alarm Regarding Potential Tether-Fueled Bubble,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 08:44:00 GMT",U.Today,"David Schwartz, CTO of Ripple and co-creator of XRP, has weighed in on the growing concerns over Tether's influence on the Bitcoin and other financial markets. These concerns revolve around allegations that Tether, through its USDT stablecoin, is artificially inflating the value of cryptocurrency and propping up the U.S. bond market. 

 The debate has been sparked by claims that Tether's operations involve a revolving door between Tether, Bitcoin and the U.S. bond market. Critics argue that by creating artificial liquidity, Tether is propping up the largest financial bubble in history. They highlight the intertwined nature of Tether and Bitcoin, suggesting that if bonds fail, BTC could follow suit due to this perplexing system. 

 It makes no difference. Whether someone does or doesn't, the newly created tether is newly created value and no existing value is destroyed. Same for bank deposits, same for loans, same for bitcoin mining.— David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) June 20, 2024 

 Tether's latest data shows that all of its tokens are pegged 1-to-1 to a corresponding fiat currency and are fully backed by Tether's reserves. These reserves consist primarily of cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury bills, precious metals, Bitcoin and other investments.  

 However, the composition of these reserves has raised eyebrows, particularly reliance on ""T-Bills,"" which make up nearly 80% of cash equivalents. 

 In response to these concerns, Schwartz emphasized the basic principles of how financial systems work. He explained that the creation of new assets, whether Bitcoin, USDT or traditional bank deposits, inherently adds value to the existing pool of assets without destroying existing value.  

 Schwartz's perspective aims to demystify the process, emphasizing that newly created assets contribute to the total value in the system, not detracting from preexisting assets.

beincrypto:7cfc074e9094b:0,Bitwise’s Bold Ethereum Ad Campaign Pokes Fun at Traditional Finance’s Limitations,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 08:43:55 GMT",Beincrypto,"Asset management giant Bitwise recently launched a groundbreaking advertisement campaign for Ethereum ETHUSD. The 39-second advertisement emphasizes Ethereum’s unique capabilities compared to traditional finance. 

 The ad, featuring Michael Tacconi as Ethereum and Jamie Kaler as Big Finance, humorously showcases Ethereum’s 24/7 accessibility. 

 Bitwise Campaign Mints TV Ad as NFT to Support Developers 

 The ad begins with Tacconi introducing himself as Ethereum, while Kaler, representing Big Finance, appears exhausted from his workday. Ethereum highlights its continuous availability, starkly contrasting Big Finance’s limited schedule. 

 It cleverly demonstrates Ethereum’s capabilities in stablecoins, NFTs, and loans, which are accessible 24/7. This humorous yet informative approach aims to educate and engage viewers about Ethereum’s benefits. 

 Victoria Kulbanska Anderson, Bitwise’s Head of Growth Marketing, acknowledged Ethereum as the most versatile blockchain. She also expressed excitement about the campaign’s potential to highlight Ethereum’s features in an accessible and humorous way. 

 “With this campaign, we wanted to bring that versatility to life in a memorable way. There’s something about personifying Ethereum as a contrast to legacy financial and tech platforms that both highlight its potential and spotlights just how inefficient the status quo can be. With these ads, we’re excited to point to Ethereum’s groundbreaking potential with the approachability, wit, and crypto-native ethos that has always defined Bitwise,” she explained. 

 The ad campaign will run on several of the nation’s largest business news networks and other paid channels. Additionally, Bitwise launches the ad as a non-fungible token NFTUSDT. Viewers can mint the “Big Finance Sleeps” video as an NFT on Zora Network. 

 At the time of writing, it has been minted 1,479 times and is part of the “Ethereum vs. Status Quo” NFT collection. Proceeds from the minting will be split evenly between the Protocol Guild, which supports Ethereum open-source developers, and the video’s actors. 

 Bitwise’s ad release followed a similar move from another asset manager, VanEck. BeInCrypto reported in May that VanEck launched an Ethereum advertisement less than an hour after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced the approval of the 19b-4 form for spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This 37-second video emphasizes Ethereum’s potential and questions its role in fostering a less centralized, open-source economy. 

 Earlier this week, Bitwise filed its updated S-1 form with the SEC for its spot Ethereum ETF. The updated form disclosed a $2.5 million seed investment and a $100 million potential share purchase from venture capitalist Pantera Capital. 

 The final approval from the SEC is crucial for these ETFs to begin trading. Although the SEC has approved the 19b-4 form, issuers still require approval for their S-1 forms to proceed. Analysts, such as James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas from Bloomberg Intelligence, have projected that trading could potentially start as early as July 2.

u_today:7097d3c0f094b:0,3 Key Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Levels to Watch for Reversal,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 08:36:00 GMT",U.Today,"Shiba Inu is in a dire state after the most recent price plunge. However, things may turn around quickly; the cryptocurrency market is certainly known for that. The key levels to watch if you are trying to catch the falling knife will most likely be $0.000018, $0.000015 and $0.0000096. Let's discover why. 

 First off, the significance of the $0.000018 level lies in the fact that it is the recent support level that SHIB must regain in order to exhibit any indications of a possible reversal. In the past, this level has served as a solid area of resistance and support. It is encouraging that SHIB is now consolidating at that level. Shiba Inu/USDT Chart by TradingView 

 Furthermore, the weekly chart's 100 EMA indicates the $0.000015 level, which is a crucial technical indicator. A notable level of support or resistance is frequently the 100 EMA. If SHIB rises above this moving average, it might be an indication that the asset is starting to stabilize and could draw in more buyers. Preserving any bullish momentum and averting additional declines require holding above this level. 

 Finally, representing an important long-term support level is $0.0000096. For SHIB, this level stands as both a psychological barrier and a historical support area. Although a significant pullback from recent highs would be indicated by a drop to this level, long-term investors and those who have not yet received exposure to SHIB might find a compelling opportunity to purchase.  

 There is a good chance of a significant price reversal and a strong accumulation phase if there is a bounce from this level. The price action on the SHIBUSDT charts indicates that these levels are crucial. As seen by the RSI falling below 40 on both the daily and weekly charts, SHIB has entered oversold territory as a result of the recent downtrend, which is the first signal of a reversal.

 In his latest market commentary, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital drew fresh comparisons between Bitcoin BTCUSD price action this year and in 2023. 

 BTC price forms “similar looking range” to 2023 

 Bitcoin may be firmly rangebound since its latest block subsidy halving in April, but the lack of BTC price upside should not concern bulls, Rekt Capital suggests. 

 Looking at Bitcoin bull market phases past and present, he showed that as recently as 2023, BTCUSD experienced extended periods of nonvolatile moves. 

 “Bitcoin tends to form Re-Accumulation Ranges after the Halving,” he summarized on X. 

 Cointelegraph 

 An accompanying chart directly compared the current status quo to a multimonth consolidation phase that spanned the second and third quarters of 2023. 

 Should such a setup be in place now, Bitcoin would remain in its narrow trading corridor for several more months. 

 Other analysis meanwhile argued that this week’s BTC price correction was “long overdue” based on previous bull markets. 

 Here, a chart pitted 2024 against the early innings of the Bitcoin bull market in mid-2016.Cointelegraph 

 Bitcoin hash rate in limbo with price 

 As Cointelegraph reported, the so-called “re-accumulation phase” is being reflected not only in price but also in miner activity. 

 Since the halving cut miners’ per-block subsidy by 50%, a new “capitulation” has begun, per the popular Hash Ribbons metric. 

 This compares the 30-day average hashrate to its 60-day equivalent, and when the former drops below the latter, “capitulation” begins. Historically, such periods have signaled suitable buying opportunities, with the last occurring in Q3 of 2023. 

 “I know it sucks, but BTC is not going to break all time highs until more pain and boredom plays out,” Willy Woo, creator of the onchain statistics platform Woobull, commented about the phenomenon this week.

beincrypto:7e998f73e094b:0,Why Is the Crypto Market Down Today?,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 08:14:36 GMT",Beincrypto,"While the total crypto market cap (TOTAL) did not paint green on the charts, it did not observe many outflows either. Bitcoin’s price is hovering below the crucial support of $64,883, and altcoins such as ZKsync (ZK) are not doing too well either. 

 In the news today:- 

 The Total Market Cap Remains Subdued 

 The total cryptocurrency market capitalization is trying to transform its current uptrend line into a support level after experiencing billions of dollars worth of outflows within this week. The market cap is currently at $2.29 trillion, staying above the important support level of $2.29 trillion. 

 Holding above this key support, If the uptrend line successfully turns into support, it could also breach past the $2.39 trillion resistance level. This is crucial for the market cap to recover and reach the $2.50 trillion mark again. 

 However, if this conversion fails, the uptrend line may become invalid, and TOTAL could potentially drop below $2.29 trillion, likely to $2.20 trillion. 

 Bitcoin’s Price Loses Support 

 Bitcoin’s price at $64,607 failed to rebound from the critical support level of $64,883, a threshold that had been tested multiple times. Although BTC hadn’t indicated an imminent rally, it appeared to be on the path to recovery. 

 However, as Bitcoin’s price failed to maintain the $64,883 support level, it could witness further declines, with prices potentially dropping to $63,700 or even $61,000. 

 On the other hand, if BTC reclaims $64,883, it could bounce back and re-establish $68,500 as a support level. This would catalyze progress towards the all-time high of $73,650. However, this recovery might take some time, given the current market conditions. 

 ZKsync Takes a Hit 

 ZKsync’s price, currently at $0.19, fell below the support of $0.20. Given that the altcoin launched just this week, some volatility is not surprising. This would also bring out key support and resistance levels for the altcoin.  

 At the time of writing, ZK appeared to have fallen 14% over the past 24 hours. This drawdown was in response to probable profit taking following the recent uptick. 

 Further drawdown is possible, but whether ZK can recover from it is the question.

newsbtc:c0c384b6d094b:0,"3 Reasons To Invest In Ethereum, 1 To Stay Bitcoin-Only: Bitwise CIO","Fri, 21 Jun 2024 08:00:31 GMT",NewsBTC,"In a recent commentary shared on X, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management, which ranks as the world’s largest provider of cryptocurrency index funds, detailed why investors should consider diversifying their cryptocurrency portfolio by adding Ethereum (ETH), alongside maintaining a position in Bitcoin (BTC). Hougan offered three compelling reasons for investors to embrace ETH, while also presenting a critical viewpoint for remaining invested solely in BTC. 

 Ethereum Vs. Bitcoin: 3 Reasons Pro-Ethereum 

 Hougan began by emphasizing the importance of diversification within crypto investments. Drawing an analogy to the early days of the internet, he pointed out how difficult it is to predict which technologies or companies will dominate over the long term. “It is very hard to predict the future with precision,” Hougan remarked, referring to investors who bet on early internet companies like AOL and Pets.com, which failed to maintain their initial promise despite the internet’s overall growth. 

 Applying this lesson to crypto, Hougan advised a diversified approach to hedge against similar uncertainties. Ethereum’s current market capitalization stands at approximately $420 billion, which is substantial but still only about one-third that of Bitcoin’s $1.3 trillion market cap. Given these figures, Hougan proposed a default starting allocation of 75% Bitcoin and 25% Ethereum for investors seeking broad market exposure. 

 Hougan’s second point delved into the functional differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum. He described Bitcoin as primarily “a new form of money,” highlighting its design choices aimed at enhancing its utility as a robust monetary system. “Every design choice the Bitcoin ecosystem makes is designed to make Bitcoin the best form of money that has ever existed,” he stated, underscoring Bitcoin’s targeted development toward optimizing its use as a currency. 

 Conversely, Ethereum is characterized by its role as a foundational technology for building new applications that leverage its capability for programmable money. This includes everything from issuing stablecoins to enabling complex decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. 

 “Ethereum’s primary function is making money programmable,” Hougan explained. He argued that the ongoing development within the Ethereum ecosystem provides a broader exposure to the potential applications of blockchain technology, which is still in its nascent stages. 

 The third argument for Ethereum centered on historical performance data. Hougan pointed out that historically, portfolios that included Ethereum along with Bitcoin showed better performance metrics, both in absolute terms and when adjusted for risk, across full crypto market cycles. 

 “My favorite thing about that table is that the +ETH portfolio has both higher returns and a lower maximum drawdown,” he highlighted. This historical analysis suggests that Ethereum could offer better downside protection and higher potential returns, though Hougan cautioned that “past performance is no guarantee of future returns” and noted that in shorter, recent periods, a Bitcoin-only strategy would have outperformed. 

 Counterpoint: Why a Bitcoin-Only Strategy May Be Preferable 

 Addressing the other side of the coin, Hougan discussed why many investors might prefer a Bitcoin-only strategy. This perspective is especially relevant for those concerned with macroeconomic issues like the degradation of fiat currencies and inflation. 

 Hougan posited that Bitcoin’s dominant position and its community’s focus on becoming a new form of money make it likely to continue leading this space. “It has a large lead, and size matters in money,” he stated, supporting the idea that Bitcoin’s simplicity and focused use-case as digital gold could be more appealing for certain strategic investments. 

 “Money is a massive market. There’s plenty of space for BTC to run if it succeeds. […] My view, in a word: If you want to make a broad bet on crypto and public blockchains, you should own multiple crypto assets. If you want to make a specific bet on a new form of digital money, buy Bitcoin,” Hougan concluded. 

 At press time, ETH traded at $3,514.06.

 Data tracked by SoSoValue shows that the 11 listed ETFs lost $140 million on Thursday, with $1.1 billion in trading volumes. Grayscale’s GBTC – which has mostly seen outflows since its conversion to an ETF in January – led outflows at $53 million followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at $51 million. 

 BlackRock’s IBIT, the biggest ETF by assets held, was the only product that recorded net inflows at $1 million. Other products saw zero net inflow or outflow activity. 

 Such outflow activity is the worst since late April, which saw $1.2 billion in total net outflows in trading sessions from April 24 to May 2. Inflows since picked up and saw the products add more than $4 billion in the next 19 days of trading – before the ongoing outflow deluge started on June 10.

u_today:2b186d361094b:0,Michael Saylor Pitches Bitcoin to Dell CEO,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 07:46:47 GMT",U.Today,"MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor has already pitched Bitcoin to Michale Dell, claiming that it represents ""digital scarcity."" 

 This comes after the chief executive officer of US computer giant Dell recently stirred excitement among Bitcoiners with his Thursday social media post. ""Scarcity creates value,"" Dell wrote on X, seemingly alluding to Bitcoin's fixed supply limit.  

 The cryptic social media post ignited speculation within the cryptocurrency community about what prompted the 59-year-old billionaire to post this statement on his social media account.  

 As reported by U.Today, Dell previously claimed that he was not interested in Bitcoin despite thinking that blockchain, the underlying technology behind the largest cryptocurrency, was ""underrated.""  

 It remains to be seen whether the likes of Saylor can make Dell adopt a more friendly stance toward Bitcoin. In 2020, Saylor's casual social media exchange with Tesla Elon Musk convinced Tesla CEO Elon Musk to buy the largest cryptocurrency.  

 Notably, Dell started accepting Bitcoin in 2014, becoming the largest merchant to embrace the cryptocurrency. However, the computer giant ditched Bitcoin due to low demand in 2017.  

 After failing as a means of payment, Bitcoin has reinvented itself as a store of value that primarily competes with gold. However, not everyone is buying into this narrative.

cointelegraph:79aa1c4d1094b:0,Fake ID crypto exchange sign-ups attract 2-year prison sentence,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 07:41:48 GMT",Cointelegraph,"An Australian man has been sentenced to two years in prison for cyber-enabled identity theft, including using fake documents to create online cryptocurrency accounts.  

 On June 21, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) reported that a 31-year-old Aussie man was sentenced at the Melbourne County Court. The man was charged following an international investigation into a website selling fraud-enabling technology linked to over 1 million Australian dollars ($670,000) theft from victims. 

 Operation Stonefish unveils cybercrime network 

 The AFP launched its Operation Stonefish in August 2022 after United Kingdom authorities investigated a website offering spoofing services for as little as 20 British pounds. The site facilitated identity theft and financial fraud. 

 Report Cyber, an Australian Commonwealth Government site for cybercrime reporting, received a complaint from a victim in New South Wales about an unauthorized bank account creation. Cointelegraph 

 AFP inquiries revealed that the Australian man opened accounts on two cryptocurrency exchanges using fake driver’s licenses with the real victims’ details and his own photo. 

 Arrest and evidence seizure 

 In November 2022, AFP officers executed a search warrant at the man’s home in Boronia. They seized blank and fake driver’s licenses, a lost passport and various cards in other people’s names.  

 The authorities also found an encrypted messaging platform on the man’s computer containing discussions about identity-based crime and instruction manuals on creating false documents. The man refused to provide access codes to his devices during the search.  

 Detective Superintendent Tim Stainton emphasized the severe impact of identity theft. He said:  

 “A stolen identity and the use of associated fraudulent documentation can have a devastating impact on people’s lives if sold online or used for criminal purposes,” Stainton added.  

 Conviction and sentencing 

 The Australian man was convicted of several charges under the country’s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 and the Criminal Code. These included providing false information, dealing with proceeds of crime, producing and possessing false documents and failing to comply with a court order. 

 He was sentenced to two years imprisonment, with a 10-month non-parole period. The authorities highlighted that the case underscores the far-reaching consequences of cyber-enabled identity theft and the importance of international cooperation in combating such crimes.

the_block:748194c58094b:0,"Consensys asks IRS to delay new crypto reporting rules, citing lack of clarity","Fri, 21 Jun 2024 07:24:55 GMT",The Block,"Blockchain development firm Consensys sent a letter to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service requesting the delay of the proposed tax regulation requiring brokers and exchanges to report certain sales of cryptocurrencies. 

 “We must echo our overarching concern … that certain aspects of the regulations do not sufficiently consider the burden on the would-be broker, which currently includes entities that do not traditionally have any reporting obligations,” the letter said. 

 In April, the IRS published an early version of Form 1099-DA, which stems from tax reporting rules proposed last August that said crypto brokers would be treated similarly to traditional brokers for products such as stocks and bonds. Under the proposed rules, entities defined as brokers would need to file 1099-DA forms on behalf of customers in case of certain crypto transactions. 

 In the draft form, the tax agency lists types of brokers as kiosk operators, digital asset payment processors, hosted wallet providers, unhosted wallet providers, and others. 

 Consensys, the developer behind the MetaMask wallet, criticized the draft form for lacking clear instructions and being overly broad in its definition of a broker, potentially leading to multiple parties reporting the same transaction. 

 “For instance, the Draft Form has not been published with instructions for brokers, presenting an insurmountable challenge when asked to create a plan to implement the Draft Form,” Consensys said in the letter. “Said simply, it is unclear how to report in several boxes of the Draft Form.” 

 The blockchain firm also raised concerns about the proposed rules’ ability to address data privacy issues within the crypto industry. In addition to these concerns, Consensys pointed out that brokers face limited time to comply before the upcoming tax filing deadline. 

 “It cannot be more emphatically stated that providing software developers, now proposed to be brokers, with a form that requires manual inputs to complete would single-handedly destroy U.S. companies that publish blockchain user interfaces like self-custody wallets,” the letter added. 

 In an X post, Consensys’ senior counsel Bill Hughes encouraged other firms potentially affected by the tax form to comment on the regulation by Friday. 

 Previously, Ji Kim, chief legal and policy officer at the Crypto Council for Innovation, said on X that the IRS listing unhosted wallet providers as brokers was “unfortunate.” 

 “This fails to recognize, among other things, that a wallet provider, as a software tech provider, does not have knowledge of the nature of transactions processed, nor the identity of the parties to the transaction,” Kim said.

cointelegraph:cea4cabe4094b:0,Binance exec legal battle escalates amid US-Nigeria tug of war,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 07:08:56 GMT",Cointelegraph,"The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) pressed ahead with its money laundering case against Binance and its executive, Tigran Gambaryan, on Thursday, June 20, prompting a response from his wife, Yuki Gambaryan. 

 According to local media, the EFCC’s lead counsel, Ekele Iheanacho, appeared during the proceedings, allowing the cross-examination of the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission Director, Abdulkadir Abbas, to proceed. 

 This development comes just days after a court cleared Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla — who had fled Nigeria — of tax evasion charges related to Binance in a case brought by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on Friday, June 14. 

 The court decided in a short ruling following new amended charges filed by the FIRS due to a notice from Binance about its appointment of a Nigerian representative, Ayodele Omotilewa. 

 Family reaction 

 In a statement to the press, Gambaryan’s wife expressed her confusion about why the EFCC cannot follow FIRS and release her husband. She also urged the United States government to expedite his release. She said: 

 Lawmakers advocate for Gambaryan’s release 

 Two members of the U.S. Congress, Representatives Chrissy Houlahan and French Hill, met Gambaryan in Kuje Prison in Nigeria on Thursday, June 20. According to Hill, Gambaryan has suffered from malaria and double pneumonia and has lost a lot of weight due to neglect in the provision of medical attention.Cointelegraph 

 Houlahan and Hill have called for Gambaryan’s immediate humanitarian release, given the poor prison conditions and his health state. 

 The lawmakers’ visit came after 18 U.S. Congress members wrote a joint letter to President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken urging them to intervene to end Gambaryan’s detention. 

 Background of the case 

 Binance regional manager Anjarwalla and head of financial crime compliance Gambaryan were detained in Nigeria on Feb. 26. Gambaryan had traveled to the country from the U.S. to participate in the company’s defense against tax evasion and money laundering charges. 

 Binance and its executives faced two separate cases by the FIRS and EFCC. The former centered on tax evasion, while the latter involved money laundering and foreign exchange contravention.

 The SOL ecosystem has progressively become the go-to blockchain for new tokens, especially meme coins, solidifying its position in the industry. 

 Solana Likened to Apple’s MacOS 

 In a “Blockchain Letter,” three executives at Pantera Capital have likened the Solana ecosystem to Apple’s macOS. The letter cites general partner Franklin Bi, portfolio manager Cosmo Jiang, and investment analyst Eric Wallach as quoting blockchain oligopoly. 

 Pantera executives acknowledge the power of the Ethereum blockchain seen with its developer dominance (70-80%). Nevertheless, they highlight Solana as a formidable contender, especially over the past year. 

 “Ethereum’s dominance appears to be yielding to the multi-polar model. Solana has gained a significant share over the past year. The shift is reminiscent of Microsoft’s dominance of the early desktop computer market until Apple broke through with its vertically integrated approach. Solana is now a major contender for the future of blockchain development,” the experts wrote. 

 Further, they cite the Solana blockchain’s “architectural advantages” that make it superior to peers like Ethereum and Cosmos. These tenets make the SOL network desirable for use cases such as content distribution, DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure networks), and CLOBs (central limit order books). Solana’s high-performance blockchain also enables the creation of capital-efficient financial markets, such as CLOB-based Phoenix and lending protocol MarginFi. 

 A March research also branded Solana the Apple of crypto, citinginnovation focused on leveraging hardware for Web3 experience enhancement. Its network performance and commitment to community and ecosystem development set it apart. Technical enhancements and strategic partnerships also reflect Solana’s leadership in bridging blockchain with financial systems. 

 SOL Records Strong Fundamental Growth 

 The letter also highlights fundamental growth in the Solana blockchain, including user growth and accelerating transaction fees. These developments have positioned it as the primary destination for retail users and memecoin traders, displacing Ethereum’s NFT dominance from the previous cycle. 

 The chain has seen a significant increase in unique active addresses, rising 1,342% between 2020 and 2023, from 14,000 to 202,000. It has now reached 1.34 million, marking a remarkable growth in user activity. 

 The report noted the intensity of demand for block space on Solana, which is seen with rising priority fees on the network. New tokens are also sprouting atop the SOL chain, beating what is seen on BNB, Ethereum, and Polygon blockchains. 

 “By May 2024, Solana accounted for 85% of all new tokens appearing on DEXs, up from 50% a year ago. This rise in Solana-based tokens reflects its strength in retail usage, driven by memecoin activity,” the report notes. 

 The dominance of Solana’s leading wallet, Phantom, in the iOS app store rankings, also reflects the growth of retail users on the SOL chain. The execs ascribe the retail influx mostly to the memecoin trading boom on Solana decentralized exchanges (DEXs). 

 Noteworthy, Solana’s share of DEX volume has skyrocketed by more than 24% since 2021, an astonishing growth that saw it capture over 60% of incremental DEX volume in May 2024 alone.  

 This points to significant momentum behind Solana’s DEX ecosystem, highlighting the contribution of its high-performance architecture in enabling rapid growth in market share. The report concludes that soaring user activity and DEX volumes have translated into real economic value for SOL holders.

The 28% surge comes just days before FET’s scheduled merger with other AI tokens into the much-anticipated Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI). 

 Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales On The Move – Is A $100,000 Price Tag Coming? 

 Bullish Brew: AI Market Momentum And Upcoming Alliance Fuel FET’s Rise 

 The recent surge in FET’s price appears to be a confluence of positive factors. The general AI market is experiencing a boom, fueled by the success stories of Elon Musk’s xAI advancements and Nvidia’s recent claim to the title of the world’s most valuable company. This positive sentiment seems to be spilling over to AI-focused cryptocurrencies, with FET being a prime beneficiary. 

 The upgrade from the $FET Network to $ASI Network is coming soon. Now the question is, how soon?  

 In the latest 𝕏 Spaces session on the @ASI_Alliance account, @HMsheikh4, the CEO of https://t.co/g4CLYbPU8e and Artificial Superintelligence Alliance stated that those holding… pic.twitter.com/Eg3bAq8e9t 

 Adding fuel to the fire is the impending launch of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance on July 15th. This merger, which will see FET join forces with Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) and SingularityNET (AGIX), has been generating significant buzz within the crypto community. The promise of a unified force in the AI crypto space is likely contributing to the current bullishness surrounding FET. 

 $FET 

 That what we call a big bounce ! pic.twitter.com/O6Nczu83ip 

 Further bolstering the positive outlook is a surge in trading activity. Derivatives markets witnessed a massive 210% increase in FET’s trading volume, indicating renewed interest from traders. Additionally, short-sellers are facing significant liquidations, suggesting a short-term squeeze and a potential trend reversal in FET’s favor. 

 NewsBTC 

 Overbought Territory And User Apprehension 

 However, not everyone is convinced of FET’s long-term prospects. The token’s meteoric rise has pushed its Relative Strength Index (RSI) to 75 on the 4-hour charts, which signifies that it might be entering overbought territory. This suggests a potential correction could be on the horizon, as investors who bought in early might be tempted to take profits. 

 Moreover, user sentiment appears to be mixed. While social media discussions surrounding FET have reached levels not seen since March 2024, a significant portion of users on Binance, a leading crypto exchange, seem to be bearish on the token’s long-term future. This discrepancy highlights a potential disconnect between casual investors and more seasoned traders. 

 Adding to the uncertainty is a recent incident on Binance. A warning message regarding FET’s delisting on July 1st (later clarified to be the delisting of the FET/USDT trading pair) caused a temporary dip in the token’s price. This episode underscores the potential for confusion and volatility surrounding the upcoming merger.

u_today:0aa61b642094b:0,"Meme Coins Dominate Solana (SOL) DEX Volume, Here's What It Means","Fri, 21 Jun 2024 16:07:00 GMT",U.Today,"In the race for programmable layer-1 dominance, Solana SOLUSD has featured high in the rankings lately. As reported earlier, Solana has even toppled Ethereum ETHUSD on many occasions in relation to its decentralized exchange (DEX) volume. As recently highlighted by market analyst @WazzCrypto on X, about 92% of the Solana DEX volume comes from meme coin trading. 

 Solana suffered from meme coin hype 

 Meme coins are now a sensation in the digital currency ecosystem. In the top 20 of the most capitalized digital currencies, two meme coins are featured, including Dogecoin DOGEUSD and Shiba Inu SHIBUSD. While these two dominate the meme coin scene, Solana-based variants like BONK and dogwifhat (WIF) are also major tokens to reckon with. 

 Notably, BONK and WIF are established on the market, but judging by its lower fees and high throughput, Solana has recorded a massive influx of new meme coins over the past year. This influx has done a lot of harm to Solana as it has helped in fee generation. 

 One major limitation that pushed some innovators out of the Ethereum ecosystem in search of new alternatives is its congestion woes. The first quarter of this year was challenging for Solana with the explosive meme coin market.  

 With dedication and the right push, Solana developers finally launched a major fix on the mainnet. It is, however, worth noting that reliance  

 Can Solana compare to Ethereum? 

 Per the data shared by Wazz, the dominance share of meme coins on Solana grew from 25% in November 2023 to the 90% seen today. This is a major leap in an extremely large unpredictable asset class. 

 92% of Solana's Top DEX volume is memecoins pic.twitter.com/8LiFCKT0Fy— Wazz (@WazzCrypto) June 20, 2024 

 High-profile decentralized finance (DeFi) applications like Jito and Marinade Finance are contributing the bulk of the transactions on Solana, so it remains unsustainable. Ethereum, on the other hand, had its underlying spot ETF approved in the U.S. As the race for dominance heats up, Solana’s catchup strategy needs to decouple from meme coins for longer-term sustainability.

u_today:7707bc984094b:0,2.35 Billion ADA in Play: Cardano's Likely Price Move,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 16:00:00 GMT",U.Today,"Cardano ADAUSD, the 10th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is currently trading within a crucial price range that holds significant implications for its short-term price movement. 

 Cardano ADAUSD was down 0.82% to $0.382 at the time of writing, having fallen as low as $0.375 earlier in the day. ADA is mirroring a broader market sell-off, which saw Bitcoin slump to a more than one-month low, and the crypto market rally is showing signs of fatigue in the absence of fresh market catalysts. ADA fell to a low of $0.366 on June 18 and is still down 8.76% weekly. Global In/Out of the Money, Courtesy: IntoTheBlock 

 According to data from IntoTheBlock, a notable 2.35 billion ADA were acquired by 159,400 addresses within Cardano's current range of $0.38 to $0.394, averaging out to $0.387 per ADA. This accumulation marks a key support zone for the ADA price. 

 What's next for ADA price? 

 The present trading range, where substantial buying activity occurred, highlights a critical support level. If the Cardano price declines further, market watchers and ADA holders might look to the next anticipated support zone, which lies between $0.373 and $0.38. This range could provide a safety net for the cryptocurrency, potentially curbing further declines. 

 On the flip side, if ADA's price rebounds from its current levels, it may face its next significant resistance between $0.394 and $0.437. Within this upper range, 2.64 billion ADA were bought by 206,880 addresses, with an average price of $0.414. This area could present a formidable challenge for upward momentum, requiring strong buying pressure to break through. 

 Currently, on-chain data suggests that the ADA price might be reaching a crucial juncture. The enormous volume of ADA bought at the highlighted price levels indicates significant support, but it might also suggest potential resistance that could slow down bullish momentum. Traders can keep an eye on these critical price points for cues as to ADA's next big move as well as broader market trends and investor sentiment.

the_block:78b795ba9094b:0,"SEC closed the book on its Ethereum 2.0 investigation, but legal questions remain","Fri, 21 Jun 2024 15:51:32 GMT",The Block,"The Securities and Exchange Commission's move to close its ""Ethereum 2.0"" investigation of Consensys raises the question: So, is ether not a security?  

 Sources say that's still not entirely clear. 

 Consensys announced on Tuesday that the SEC's enforcement division notified the blockchain and web3 development company that it was closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0 in a ""major win"" and said that it meant that the SEC ""would not bring charges alleging that sales of ETH are securities transactions."" This comes after the firm sent a letter in June asking the agency to confirm that the spot ether exchange-traded fund approvals in May meant that it would end its investigation into ""Ethereum 2.0.""  

 In a letter sent June 18 to Consensys from the SEC's Chicago Regional Office, the agency said it had ""concluded the investigation in the above-referenced matter."" 

 ""While we do not with this notice, or otherwise, agree with the factual statements or legal conclusions set forth in the June 4 Letter, based on the information we have as of this date, we do not intend to recommend an enforcement action by the Commission against your client, Consensys Software Inc. with respect to this investigation,"" the SEC said.  

 Consensys previously said the SEC's Director of the Division of Enforcement, Gurbir Grewal, approved the investigation into ""Ethereum 2.0"" in March 2023 to investigate individuals and entities buying and selling ether.  

 The question of whether ether is a security or a commodity has been up in the air for a while. The SEC's Chair, Gary Gensler, has not explicitly stated that ether is a security. Meanwhile, at the SEC's sister agency, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam has asserted that ether is a commodity. 

 The SEC's move to close its investigation does tip the scales into ether being treated as a commodity, said Teresa Goody Guillén, a partner at BakerHostetler law firm and former litigation counsel for the SEC, in an email. 

 ""The SEC reportedly closing its investigation into ether does not mean that this Commission is definitely concluding that ether is not a security,"" she said. ""But it does provide another data point that this Commission has concluded not to bring an action alleging that ether is a security at this time."" 

 A former SEC enforcement attorney who asked not to be named said the SEC could have decided to throw out the investigation either because it has decided that ether is not a security or because it was too much of a litigation risk for the agency to take.  

 The lawyer said in an interview with The Block that the SEC could also decide to hedge future statements on whether ether is a security.  

 ""It's possible that they'll come out and say, well, you know Consensys' issuance of eth is not a securities transaction, but it's possible in some other formation eth could be issued as a security, or maybe they'll make some more definitive statement,"" the former SEC attorney said. ""I think the important thing to remember is that I don't think closing this case necessarily means that they have decided that there is no security here. It just could be that they've decided they don't want to risk litigating it.""  

 Next steps 

 Consensys has said it still plans to pursue its lawsuit against the SEC. The firm sued the agency in April over its approach to regulating Ethereum and said at the time that the SEC ""trained its sights"" on the firm's MetaMask software. In the complaint, the firm also said it received a Wells notice, meaning a formal notice that the agency plans to bring an enforcement action against them.  

 The firm is seeking relief for MetaMask and for the SEC to say that Consensys is not acting as a broker-dealer or participating in the sale of securities through its MetaMask Swaps and MetaMask Staking products. The SEC has to respond to Consensys' complaint by July 1.  

 The SEC's Wells notice means that the agency is still likely pursuing Consensys, said Marc Fagel, former regional director at the SEC, in an interview.  

 ""At this point, there's no basis to conclude they're changing their stance on aggressive enforcement actions in the crypto space,"" Fagel said.  

 The agency's decision to close its investigation doesn't set policy, Fagel said. However, the SEC is unlikely to bring cases involving Ethereum in the future, he added.  

 ""This pretty strongly suggests that the SEC is not going to keep pursuing any cases involving sales of these, whether it's the issuer of the asset or exchanges that are facilitating trades,"" Fagel said.  

 As for whether the close of Ethereum 2.0 means anything for spot Ethereum ETFs, BakerHostetler's Teresa Goody Guillén says it could lend support. 

 ""The closing of the SEC’s investigation lends more support for the position that ether is a commodity,"" she said. ""Each ETF’s registration statements are still under review through a separate process and any delays would likely be unrelated to ether being treated as a security, particularly given that each ETF’s registration statement was amended to preclude staking of ether received or managed by the ETF."" 

 The SEC approved 19b-4 forms for eight spot Ethereum ETFs last month, but those products still need the agency greenlight for registration forms as part of a two-step process. Some ETF issuers received comments from the SEC last week on their S-1 forms with a deadline of Friday to turn them around, according to reporting from The Block.

u_today:b9ef9e077094b:0,Ripple CLO Ends Speculation on XRP's Status in California,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 15:49:00 GMT",U.Today,"Ripple's Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty has clarified the legal status of XRP in California, addressing recent concerns following a court ruling. The token, owned by San Francisco-based Ripple, has been under scrutiny as a civil securities lawsuit in Oakland moves forward. 

 As reported by U.Today, yesterday, the district court judge allowed the lawsuit to move forward, ruling that it would be up to a jury to decide whether XRP qualifies as a security for retail buyers on exchanges. 

 However, Alderoty emphasized that the California judge dismissed all allegations, suggesting that Ripple violated federal securities laws. The only remaining claim in California, based on a 2017 declaration, involves state law and is scheduled for trial. 

 The plaintiff in that case, who did not purchase XRP directly from Ripple and is uncertain whether he was affected by the 2017 statement, reportedly lost a small amount of money on his trades. Ripple looks forward to cross-examination in this matter, Alderoty said. 

 One state law claim, based on a 2017 statement, is going to trial. The plaintiff -- who didn’t buy directly from Ripple and can’t say if he even heard the statement before he traded -- allegedly lost a couple hundred $. We look forward to that cross examination. 2/2— Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) June 21, 2024 

 This decision stands in contrast to an earlier ruling by Judge Analisa Torres, who found that secondary sales of XRP were not securities, a decision that initially appeared to favor Ripple. Thus, the popular cryptocurrency is not classified as a security in New York, a position that remains unchanged. 

 The latest development follows a pattern of inconsistent rulings from state to state, highlighting the need for federal legislation to provide a consistent regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.

cointelegraph:825cdcc0f094b:0,How to growth hack Web3 marketing like an OG,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 15:44:51 GMT",Cointelegraph,"The world of crypto, blockchain and the wider Web3 space has been expanding and doing so at rapid speed.  

 Its humble origins as a safe-haven niche for fintech enthusiasts using blockchain to beat the traditional financial system have evolved. It’s now an industry that regulators want to control, celebrities endorse, and some of the biggest institutions are investing in.  

 This means that in just a decade, the story being told about the space to outsiders in an effort to lure them in as long-term users has also shifted. How do you tell a story about an ecosystem with very little history? How do you sell an idea that is constantly in a state of evolution? 

 Cointelegraph spoke exclusively with Amanda Cassatt during Proof of Talk in Paris. Cassatt is the founder and CEO of Serotonin, a leading Web3 marketing company. She was formerly the chief marketing officer of Consensys and explains how she built one of the most successful marketing empires, telling the stories of Web3. Cointelegraph 

 Storytelling where there is none 

 Cassatt’s own journey into the crypto space began in 2015 as a founder in New York who was searching for a payment solution. It was then that she stumbled upon one of the early Ethereum meetups.  

 “What I noticed, even though I wasn’t able to do due diligence on the codebase - was that this was a group of the smartest people that I had ever met and they were the most excited that I'd seen anyone of this number, this smart, probably in my whole life,” she explained.  

 Cassatt said it took them “a while” to explain the concepts behind Ethereum to her, as it wasn’t thoroughly or properly explained in “accessible ways” for non-technical people at the time. She added that the realization that Web3 could be an ""alternate foundation"" of a ""superior financial system"" blew her mind: 

 This was the point at which she realized she had to join what she called the circus at the time. 

  “I realized that a lot of the folks in that crew didn't really have storytelling backgrounds and weren't familiar with how the media works,"" Cassatt explained. 

 Eventually, growing into her role at Consensys, she became part of creating some of those explanations.  

 Growth hacker roots 

 However, telling the stories of a relatively nascent space, especially in the 2015-2017 era, things were a lot different.  

 Cassatt explained that words like crypto, Bitcoin or Ethereum weren’t allowed on any paid platform such as Mailchimp, Google Ads, or Facebook — any of the Meta business suite platforms that are key to digital marketers. Cointelegraph 

 She said that there was no way to do standard Web2 style programmatic advertising that catered towards the emerging sector: 

 According to the Serotonin CEO, there are three kinds of marketing: owned, earned and paid. What they focused on in the early days of Consensys was owned and earned.  

 Seeing more paid growth marketing in the space is a “reflection of the space maturing,” which Cassatt considers a positive development. 

 Organizing the organizers 

 One of the most effective tactics she recalled employing on behalf of Consensys was building a network of meetup organizers. She described this as people who wanted to add the “Ethereum meetup organizer” title for a certain city to their identity.  

 ""We made sure they had the money for pizza and beer, or the culturally relevant equivalents,"" she said, ""or that they had standard decks and presentation templates to kind of standardize and professionalize how they were speaking about projects.” 

 Cassatt said they eventually curated a roving content series of new DApps that would go on tour through all of the different meetups and pick up users and get feedback.  

 This meant there was always fresh and organic content, and that came with more efficiency of not having to organize every single meetup group ourselves.  

 “You make sure that you have a system that people want to opt into - an incentive framework with intrinsic and extrinsic motives. Plug people into that system, and empower them rather than having to come up with all the great ideas yourself as the marketer, then look around your community and see where there are sparks.” 

 Every company is a media company 

 Another visionary approach to the Web3 space, that can be applied to startups in a broader sense, is found in the way companies view the content they produce.  

 Cassatt said startups should consider themselves as that and have, for example, an email newsletter where it covers all of the developments going on in a certain topic or space.Cointelegraph 

 She pointed to her work at Consensys, where they launched various newsletters about “everything that was going on in Ethereum” so that people would read them for editorial value and not just production promotion.  

 Advice for the next generation 

 And while one of the most challenging aspects of being in the Web3 space - whether one is a marketer, developer, or user- is keeping up with the rapid changes, Cassatt offered some evergreen advice: 

 She said this also means that there isn't a lot of start-up training or a lot of discipline and experience in the space compared to venture funded Web2 startups.  

 “I would learn how to actually find product market fit properly for a startup, come up with an idea, test it out on your people you know, that are in your target audience, see if they want to use it, see what they would pay for it,” she said.  

 Then, after the first frame of fit with those early evangelists is found, message it to the next concentric circle of people, see what they think, and see if they would use it:

 It started Thursday when Dell posted, ""Scarcity creates value."" That prompted a reply from Saylor, the executive chairman of MicroStrategy MMSTR, saying, ""Bitcoin is Digital Scarcity,"" which Dell then reposted. 

 The exchange didn't end there, with Dell later posting an image of Sesame Street's Cookie Monster that had been digitally altered (apparently by Saylor) to show the famous children's character gobbling bitcoin instead of cookies. 

 As first CEO and now executive chairman at MicroStrategy, Saylor has not only led that company to its acquisition of 226,331 bitcoin worth $15 billion over the past almost four years (the latest being the acquisition of 11,900 BTC just this week), but he's also evangelized for other corporations to follow suit with their own balance sheets. 

 To this point, only a small number of other companies have seen fit to make bitcoin a part of their treasury strategies, and none to anywhere near the extent of what Saylor has done with MicroStrategy. 

 Per a recent filing, Dell had $34.6 billion of current assets on its balance sheet as of May 3, with $5.8 billion of that in cash and cash equivalents. Bitcoin isn't mentioned.

newsbtc:543b947d6094b:0,"Uniswap A Retailer’s Hub? Average Trade Sizes Fall From $30,000 to $1,000 In 2 Years","Fri, 21 Jun 2024 15:30:16 GMT",NewsBTC,"Crypto and some key sub-sectors, like decentralized finance (DeFi) or non-fungible token (NFT) trading or minting, remain dynamic. While activity is highly influenced by price, other changes are settled not by how prices gyrate but by time. 

 Uniswap Users Are Increasingly Posting Small Trade Sizes 

 Events in Uniswap, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum, draw the interest of Token Terminal, a blockchain analytics platform.  

 According to Token Terminal, a curious trend is happening in Uniswap: While the Ethereum ecosystem is expanding and expected to grow even more, trade sizes on Uniswap are shrinking rapidly. 

 Over the last two years, the average trade size on the popular DEX has fallen from around $30,000 registered in 2022 to roughly $1,000 at press time. Commentators speculate that this trend could point to increasing adoption, especially among retailers.  

 Compared to institutions or crypto hedge funds that might want to trade huge chunks, most retailers lack those resources. They are more comfortable with lower trade sizes. 

 This observation makes sense, especially with the explosion of meme coins deployed on the mainnet or layer-2 platforms like Base.  

 Though Uniswap first launched on the Ethereum mainnet, it is also available on Base, Arbitrum, and Polygon. It enables the trading of tokens in a low-fee environment.  

 On these platforms, market participants can trade on smaller sizes since they know the fee impact will be lower than on the mainnet.  

 Another perspective suggests that the rise of competing DEXs built on alternative blockchains like Solana and BNB Chain might be drawing activity away from Uniswap.  

 Modern blockchains like Solana offer faster transaction speeds and lower fees. With Ethereum processing 15 TPS at optimum, the higher scalability and interoperability with the first smart contracts platform can appeal to some traders. 

 DEX Users Rapidly Climbing As Ethereum Finds Regulatory Clarity 

 The decline in trade size comes surprisingly alongside a surge in overall DEX activity. Another Token Terminal report shows that monthly active traders across leading DEXs, including Uniswap, stand at 11.2 million.  

 It is roughly 3 million short of the all-time posted in December 2021. This observation suggests that though more traders post smaller sizes, more users are keen on exploring and participating.  

 Even as Uniswap’s average trade size falls, analysts are bullish on the protocol and UNI, its native token. The platform plans to launch Uniswap v4 while Ethereum now has regulatory clarity, especially with a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the way.

 According to data from Lookonchain, the trading volume of USDT on the Tron Network reached an impressive $53 billion within a single day, exceeding Visa's average daily trading volume of $42 billion. 

 The 24-hour trading volume of $USDT on #TronNetwork is $53B, exceeding Visa's average daily trading volume.

 Visa, the global payments giant, recorded a trading volume of $3.78 trillion in the first quarter of 2024. When broken down, this figure translates to an average daily trading volume of approximately $42 billion. 

 This milestone is particularly noteworthy given the established dominance of Visa in the payments industry. It underscores the rapid pace at which digital currencies are being adopted and the growing confidence that users place in them for conducting large-scale transactions. 

 The significant trading volume of Tether USDTUSD on the TRON network indicates a shift in how value is being transferred globally. This trend is likely to continue as more users and institutions recognize the benefits of digital currencies. 

 As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, such milestones as highlighted above are likely to become more frequent, indicating the wider acceptance and integration of digital currencies into everyday commerce. 

 In Tether-related news, Tether Holdings, the issuer of USDT, the largest stablecoin on the cryptocurrency market, has created a new synthetic dollar that is backed by gold, according to a corporate announcement on Monday. 

 Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has also announced today that it has completed the integration of Tether USDTUSD on the Toncoin Network.

 Recently, Saylor’s company, MicroStrategy, conducted yet another massive Bitcoin acquisition, while the BTC price took another dive. 

 Michael Saylor hints at MicroStrategy's new logo? 

 Renowned entrepreneur and Bitcoiner Saylor published an image that depicts a furry cartoon-like creature that is eating coins with the Bitcoin sign on them. “New logo?” Saylor tweeted with that image. 

 New Logo? pic.twitter.com/oWcZFkCxK4— Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) June 21, 2024 

 This tweet brought on a heated discussion in the comments, where some X users began to ask if this is a “new logo” for MicroStrategy since the creature in this image is eating Bitcoin - similarly to Saylor’s company, which continues to make large BTC acquisitions. 

 MicroStrategy acquires more Bitcoin 

 Earlier this week, Michael Saylor announced yet another Bitcoin purchase as MicroStrategy bought another large BTC lump – 11,931 BTC, paying approximately $786 million for it. Now, the company holds a staggering 226,331 Bitcoin worth $8.33 billion in total. 

 This BTC was acquired at an average price of $65,883 per coin. MicroStrategy is now the leading corporate cryptocurrency holder by a large margin. 

 This mega Bitcoin purchase was possible thanks to the company recently raising $800 million in debt using convertible senior notes sold to investors. The initial goal was to raise $500 million to buy more BTC and to use the rest of the funds for operational expenses. 

 However, later, the goal was expanded from $500 million to $800 million.

u_today:9778b1dd8094b:0,Dogwifhat (WIF) Skyrockets 20% in Volume Amid Price Slump,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 14:58:00 GMT",U.Today,"Dogwifhat (WIF) is showing no signs of gains in terms of price. However, the good news for its holders is that other indicators are giving bullish signals. Per CoinGlass, the trading volume of WIF has skyrocketed 20% over the past day. With this surge, its volume is standing at a whopping $879.75 million. 

 If we break it down, around $500.89 million of the total volume came from crypto exchange Binance and $166.40 million from Bybit, among others. This shows us that WIF has been seeing rising trading activity across multiple platforms. 

 But the most important thing to note here is that traders are showing interest in this meme coin even though its price is currently in a bullish phase. Traders are optimistic about Dogwifhat because they may be trying to buy the lows. 

 Moreover, the coin has a history of huge rallies, so these traders may be anticipating another price rally from WIF. Whatever the reason is, the rising trading activity is a positive sign for WIF, which may help it to overcome this bearish phase. 

 WIF price outlook 

 As of this publication, the Dogwifhat price has plummeted 13.16% to $1.84. Additionally, the price has fallen 34.40% over the past month. This shows how bears have gained control over the sentiment, as seen in the broader crypto market. 

 However, there is hope left for the Solana-based meme coin. Per TradingView, the current RSI of WIF is 30.39. An RSI below 40 indicates that the coin is in an oversold market condition. Hence, Dogwifhat’s current RSI is showing that there is a potential for a price gain in the short term. 

 Considering the surge in volume and the current RSI level, one can assume that the outlook for WIF is not bleak. Meme coins like WIF have always shown their potential with massive price rallies. While volatility is expected, WIF still has the potential to rebound from its current levels.

u_today:bb67925fe094b:0,"Here's Who's Selling Bitcoin (BTC) Right Now, Pushing Price Down","Fri, 21 Jun 2024 14:43:00 GMT",U.Today,"It seems that Bitcoin's selling pressure is through the roof again as the first cryptocurrency dropped below $65,000, with more than $140 million liquidated. However, the main source of selling pressure might not have been so obvious. 

 Recent price action indicates that Bitcoin is having difficulty maintaining its hold above important support levels. With a break below the 50 EMA and an approach to the 100 EMA, the daily chart shows an extreme decline. There is also growing bearish momentum indicated by the RSI.BTCUSD Chart by TradingView 

 The fact that Coinbase is the source of the selling pressure is crucial. The Coinbase Premium Gap, a measure that contrasts the price of Bitcoin on Coinbase Pro with those on other exchanges, is significantly negative, suggesting that Coinbase is currently executing orders of institutional investors who are willing to sell their holdings. 

 The lengthy period of miner capitulation is also clarified by Willy Woo's analysis. As indicated by the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons, which show periods of stress and recovery for miners, we are currently experiencing a record-breaking amount of miner capitulation. Woo says that when the hash rate starts to rise again and weak miners leave, Bitcoin usually bounces back.  

 In a similar vein, the volume of big USD transactions has drastically decreased, suggesting that major players are scaling back or selling their holdings. The Bulls and Bears indicator which indicates a preponderance of bearish addresses highlights the bearish sentiment even more. It appears that more investors are selling rather than buying as the gap between bullish and bearish addresses has widened.  

 The combination of these data suggests that there are multiple sources of selling pressure. With enormous amounts of Bitcoin being sold on the platform, Coinbase seems to be a major driver. Furthermore, as miners sell off their holdings to pay for operating expenses, the extended miner capitulation phase intensifies the selling pressure.

 In total, CySEC flagged 17 websites, among them: tradeupyourlife.co/es/nvi/v1/lakmw/ and tradingupyourlife.com/es/v8/jdkas/#formbox, tbmarket.co, globalfx-ltd.com, and account.globalfx-ltd.com/client/login, princemarkets.com, selcukluyatirimfx.com, partnershiptrader.com, unitymarketmovers.com, trustvestszone.com, bytflex.com/web/index.php, guleryatirimholdings.com, unifyfxbusiness.com/m/index.html, exprotrades.com, centagepremium.com/index.html, topfx.pl, and strifor.org.

 In March, CySEC cautioned investors against 16 investment firms purportedly operating without proper registration. These entities were enlisted in the regulator’s warning list for lacking the necessary approvals to offer investment services or conduct investment activities. 

 CySEC Tightens Regulatory Checks 

 Among the flagged entities were prollitestockcapitol.com, crossview.online, freedomfxgroup.com, al-olymptrade.com, alloptionsint.com & client.alloptionsint.com, xbmkfx.com, ioption360.com, and recoveryoptionfx.com. 

 Notably, CySEC carried out over 700 on-site and remote inspections of supervised entities in 2023 and issued over $2.2 million in fines. These investigations and fines sought to enhance compliance with the relevant regulations and to protect investors. 

 Following the commission’s supervisory audits, CySEC levied €1 million on a single investment firm. Over the past three years, the watchdog has imposed €6 million in sanctions with €5.3 million on investment firms for regulatory violations. 

 Recently, CySEC's Chairman, Dr. George Theocharides, commented about the changing regulatory landscape during the IFX EXPO International 2024, saying: ""As organizations have adapted to changes in customer preferences, the trends that we have seen in the last ten years or so in the financial services industry are more digitalization and more online and mobile trading platforms."" 

 ""We have also seen more sophisticated technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning, which have been crucial for delivering insights and personal financial products.""

beincrypto:aab7fd1da094b:0,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple Weekly Wrap – June 21","Fri, 21 Jun 2024 14:20:43 GMT",Beincrypto,"The big three crypto assets have all had a rather bearish week, with Bitcoin’s BTCUSD price falling while Ethereum’s ETHUSD and Ripple’s XRPUSD prices consolidating. Over the weekend, all three of these assets will likely retain this outlook. 

 BeInCrypto has analyzed where BTC, ETH, and XRP could land following this bearish week. 

 Bitcoin’s Price Subdued 

 Bitcoin’s price has been following a bearish double-top pattern for the past month. A double-top pattern is a bearish reversal formation characterized by two peaks at a similar level, indicating strong resistance. 

 It suggests that the asset’s price is likely to decline after failing to break through the resistance twice. 

 As BTC broke below the neckline, intense bearishness pursued. Consequently, the crypto asset fell from the neckline at $67,504 to the trading price of $63,6723. BTC is now closer to the target price of $63,068, as set by the bearish pattern, and could hit it over the weekend. 

 At the same time, a bounce back in Bitcoin’s price is also expected. However, if it comes earlier, BTC could reclaim the support of $64,00 and $66,000. This would enable recovery and invalidate the bearish thesis. 

 Ethereum’s Price Halts Recovery 

 Ethereum’s price at $3,496 has been consolidated between $3,669 and $3,336. These levels form the 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci Retracement levels. ETH has been within this range for the last two weeks after the altcoin lost support at $3,700. 

 It remains to be seen whether Ethereum’s price can break above or below the consolidation range. However, the chances of sideways movement continuing this weekend are very high. 

 This bearish, neutral thesis would be invalidated if either of the range limits were disrupted, potentially sending ETH rallying to $3,800 or falling to $3,200 on the charts. 

 XRP Price Sees No Rally Either 

 The XRP price, hovering between $0.47 and $0.52, faces bearishness after failing the ascending triangle. Changing hands at $0.49, the altcoin could attempt to reclaim $0.51 as a support floor, which would also flip the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement into support. 

 The sideways movement could continue since the broader market cues are not supporting a recovery right now. The aforementioned consolidation range could remain intact for a while. 

 Nevertheless, the price could fall if XRP holders move to offset their losses by selling their holdings. This could result in a $0.46 or lower drawdown, invalidating the bullish–neutral thesis.

 Amid fleeing airdrop farmers, daily transactions have plummeted to remarkable depths. 

 LayerZero Called Out For Controversial Airdrop 

 Omnichain interoperability protocol LayerZero was criticized harshly one day after the launch of its native token, ZRO. It comes amid controversy over its chosen claiming mechanism for its ZRO token. The network introduced a new strategy for users to claim airdrop tokens. 

 LayerZero employed this strategy to curb Sybil entities, which are manipulative, airdrop farming bots. The protocol required airdrop participants to deposit or donate $0.10 in USDC, USDT, or ETH to Protocol Guild, a collective of Ethereum developers, to claim each ZRO token. 

 According to LayerZero, this token distribution model aligns with the protocol’s commitment to its long-term future. Further, the foundation committed to matching up to $10 million in donations to the Protocol Guild in support of Layer-1 (L1) developers on Ethereum. 

 The condition did not sit well with crypto traders. While some likened it to a “tax,” others called it out for the “proof of donation” impression it gave and criticized the protocol. In their opinion, this was nothing close to an airdrop. 

 “Because the token is in exchange for a donation, it’s technically not an airdrop, and the team didn’t call it an airdrop anywhere in their comms… they explicitly say “This is not an airdrop”. Anyone could’ve bought the no side for like 5c just hours ago and be up 10x already,” X user DCF GOD said.  

 In hindsight, LayerZero had clarified that as it neared its token generation event, the term ‘airdrop’ was deliberately avoided because the event was not an airdrop. LayerZero Labs explained in a Thursday blog post that this distinction was intentional. 

 The user also highlighted a drop in prediction platform Polymarket odds for the LayerZero airdrop, which crashed to 50% despite the token’s recent debut. 

 LayerZero Daily Transactions Plummet 

 Amidst the controversy, on-chain metrics suggest a bearish sentiment in the LayerZero ecosystem. Dune analytics data shows a drop of over 90% in daily transaction count. This repulsion away from its peak levels comes as airdrop farmers flee. 

 A drop in daily transactions may suggest fewer users actively use the crypto project. This could reflect the overall market sentiment towards the crypto project. Investors or users have done this, moving away from protocols due to negative news, regulatory concerns, or lack of development progress. 

 The negative sentiment has also extended to the protocol’s native token, ZRO, which has been down 22% in the past 24 hours. As of writing, the token is trading for $3.15, down from its $4.71 peak.

 Gambaryan, a U.S. citizen and head of financial crimes compliance for Binance has been in custody since February facing money laundering charges. Tax evasion charges against him and another official who left Nigeria in March were dropped last week. 

 French Hill, a Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, and Chrissy Houlahan, a Democrat, visited Gambaryan in Abuja's Kuje prison on Thursday during a trip to the West African country. 

 ""We have asked our embassy to advocate for a humanitarian release of Tigran because of the horrible conditions of the prison, his innocence and his health,"" Hill said in a video he posted on social media site X, alongside Houlahan. 

 Houlahan said during the prison visit, they found Gambaryan living in difficult conditions and ""he was also clearly under a lot of stress and his health is not very good."" 

 Binance has previously said Gambaryan had malaria and pneumonia. 

 Gambaryan, who denies charges against him, was in court on Friday for the money laundering trial, which was adjourned to July 1.      

 Nigeria has blamed Binance for its currency woes after cryptocurrency websites became the platforms of choice for trading the Nigerian naira as the country grappled with chronic dollar shortages and its currency fell to a record low.

cointelegraph:19dca0ac4094b:0," Nigerian SEC announces new rules, compliance program for digital assets ","Fri, 21 Jun 2024 14:15:30 GMT",Cointelegraph,"The Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has amended its rules on Digital Asset Issuance, Offering Platforms, Exchange and Custody.  

 In an official notice to the public, the SEC outlined its plans to update these critical regulations. The amendment process is designed to enhance the regulatory environment, making it more comprehensive and responsive to the complexities of digital asset markets.  

  The amendment 

 As part of this regulatory overhaul, the SEC introduced a special compliance program called the Accelerated Regulatory Incubation Programme (ARIP). This program is specifically designed for Virtual Assets Service Providers (VASPs) and offers a path for these entities to align with the new regulatory requirements. Cointelegraph 

 According to the circular on the SEC’s website, it has set up a special window for the onboarding process, that will allow VASPs to participate in the ARIP. 

 The onboarding process is accessible through the SEC ePortal. While this application process is intended to improve compliance, VASPs are directed to complete it no later than 30 days from the circular date. 

 The SEC also issued a stern warning that it will crack down on any non-compliant VASPs, enforcing regulatory actions against those that fail to adhere to the directives outlined in the circular. 

 SEC’s moves so far 

 The amendment of the initial Rules on Digital Assets Issuance, Offering Platforms, Exchange and Custody, issued in May 2022, follows the appointment of a new Director-General, Emomotimi Agama, at the SEC.  

 Meanwhile, the urgent need for the Nigerian government and regulators to responsibly regulate the virtual assets industry rather than enforcing clampdowns, crackdowns, and shutdowns has been strongly emphasized in order to reposition the Nigerian market. 

 In March, Nigeria’s SEC proposed an amendment to the rules guiding platforms offering crypto services, suggesting a hike in the registration fee for crypto exchanges from 30 million naira ($18,620) to 150 million naira ($93,000). 

 Nigeria has emerged as one of the fastest-growing crypto economies in the past few years. In 2023, it was also the second-biggest economy in terms of crypto adoption. In August 2022, Nigeria was named the most crypto-obsessed country in the world by the number of Google searches for “cryptocurrency” or “buy crypto.”

 In the past 24 hours, $33.85 million in bitcoin positions were liquidated, and over $132 million in the wider cryptocurrency market was liquidated in the same period. Of these combined crypto liquidations, the vast majority — around $105 million — were long positions, according to Coinglass data. 

 Bitcoin changed hands at around $63,649 at the time of writing, having fallen over 2.4% in the past 24 hours, according to The Block’s price page. The price of ether has dipped over 2% to $3,434 in the same period. The global cryptocurrency market cap today is $2.45 trillion, dropping 3.2% in the last 24 hours, according to Coingecko data. 

 Bitcoin bearish indicators and investor uncertainty 

 According to Stocklytics analyst Neil Roarty, bitcoin's decline to its lowest price in over a month indicates that investors are divided on the future direction of the leading cryptocurrency. Roarty stated that bears point to on-chain signals indicating that some of the largest bitcoin holders were liquidating their holdings. 

 ""The largest bitcoin holders have together sold more than $1 billion worth of the coin over the last couple of weeks,"" Roarty told The Block. ""If they know something the rest of the market doesn’t, it won’t be long until others follow the example.""  

 However, he added, bulls will conversely note that we are still only a little more than 10% down from bitcoin’s all-time high price of $73,000, reached in March. ""Bulls argue that this small regression and period of consolidation is both expected and healthy before bitcoin targets the $100,000 mark, depending on which way things break, this feels like a major inflection point for bitcoin,"" the analyst said.

u_today:53a1a8c1d094b:0,Major Crypto Wallet Issues Crucial Warning to Community: Details,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 14:06:00 GMT",U.Today,"Ledger wallet’s team has taken to the X social media platform to announce they have come across a brand new type of cryptocurrency scam that cyber criminals use to hit users' wallets to take hold of their holdings. 

 Ledger published a thread on X to explain how this scam works and how not to fall for it. 

 ""Address-poisoning scam"" 

 The new type of cryptocurrency scam, which Ledger is sounding the alarm about, is called “address poisoning.” It happens when a user suddenly sees a mysterious coin or NFT in their wallet – an asset that they had not put in there. 

 When this happens, the Ledger team warns, it is most likely that you have become a target for this new type of scam attack. When a scammer sends you some coins, this transaction gets added to your Ledger Live transaction history, and it will look like you already sent money to that wallet in the past. 

 If you've ever seen a mysterious coin or NFT appear in your wallet - one that you didn't send or ask anyone to send to you - then you may have been the target of an address-poisoning scam. 

 Want to know how address poisoning scams work and how you can avoid them? Scroll down to… pic.twitter.com/PDa2Fgov1x— Ledger (@Ledger) June 21, 2024 

 The fraudsters hope that the wallet’s owner will mistakenly copy that address from the history of transactions and use it to send funds instead of a real address. However, they cannot steal any crypto from your wallet if you are being attentive and do not initiate a transaction yourself by signing it with your Ledger. 

 Guidance on how to avoid trouble 

 The main advice on how not to fall for an address poisoning scam is simple, according to the Ledger support team; it is to ignore the malicious transaction and the wallet attached to it. 

 It is also important to avoid those suspicious tokens or NFTs that have been sent to you by scammers. A good idea here is to select the token/NFT and then select the ""Hide Token/NFT Collection"" option, the Ledger team guides. This will help you avoid accidentally interacting with this scam wallet and prevent you from sending a transaction to it.

Amidst this downward trend, Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, is not only maintaining his bullish stance on Bitcoin but actively encouraging investment, advocating a strategy to ‘buy the dip.’ His optimism and advice are deeply rooted in an analysis of global economic conditions and central bank policies, which he believes will favor cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. 

 Buy The Bitcoin Dip? 

 Hayes’s insights draw attention to the aggressive monetary policies implemented by central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve. These policies, including rapid interest rate hikes—the most aggressive since the 1980s—were initiated in response to rising inflation in the United States. The hikes have had a profound impact on the bond market, particularly affecting US Treasuries (USTs), which saw a decrease in prices due to the rising yields. Japanese banks, in search of yield amid domestically near-zero interest rates, had heavily invested in these USTs. 

 The strategy backfired when US rates rose, leading to significant paper losses for these banks. Hayes specifically points to the situation with Norinchukin Bank, which was compelled to sell off $63 billion in foreign bonds, mostly USTs, to reduce these losses. This scenario underscores a broader trend among Japanese banks, which may need to continue offloading USTs and other foreign bonds as they adjust to the new economic realities imposed by US monetary policy. 

 Hayes argues that these developments have critical implications for the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin. He notes that the responses by central banks to stabilize financial markets—such as the Federal Reserve’s decision to provide a blanket backstop in March 2023 following a series of bank failures—indirectly benefit cryptocurrencies. This intervention led to a surge in Bitcoin’s price, reinforcing its status as a viable alternative investment during times of financial instability. 

 Moreover, Hayes points out the operational details of the FIMA repo facility, which was expanded by the Fed to bolster liquidity. He explains, “A rise in the FIMA repo facility indicates an addition of dollar liquidity to the global money markets. Y’all know what that means for Bitcoin and crypto … which is why I thought it necessary to alert readers about another avenue of stealth money printing.” This mechanism allows central banks to exchange their holdings of USTs for dollars, increasing the dollar supply without flooding the market with bonds and potentially driving up yields. 

 The implications for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are profound, according to Hayes. He suggests that as central banks, particularly the Bank of Japan, might use these facilities to manage their exposure to USTs, the resultant increase in dollar liquidity could drive investors towards cryptocurrencies. This movement is seen as a hedge against potential inflation and currency debasement resulting from these monetary expansions. 

 Hayes vividly describes the effect of these macroeconomic maneuvers on the crypto market: “Just as many began to wonder where the next jolt of dollar liquidity would come from, the Japanese banking system dropped Origami cranes composed of crisply folded dollar bills upon the laps of crypto investors. This is just another pillar of the crypto bull market. The supply of dollars must increase to maintain the current Pax Americana dollar-based filthy financial system.” 

 In a rallying call to the crypto community, Hayes concludes, “Say it with me, ‘Shikata Ga Nai’, and buy the fucking dip!” Through this declaration, he underscores his belief that despite the volatile market conditions, the underlying economic and monetary developments are creating favorable conditions for Bitcoin’s growth. His analysis suggests that savvy investors should view the current price drops as buying opportunities, given the broader economic backdrop that he believes will continue to propel interest and investment in cryptocurrencies. 

 At press time, BTC traded at $64,159.

cointelegraph:d7ca17fe0094b:0,New AI portfolio management tool coming to PancakeSwap ,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 13:54:44 GMT",Cointelegraph,"Decentralized crypto exchange PancakeSwap is set to introduce CupcakeHop, an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered portfolio management tool. 

 Developed by Bril Finance and backed by PancakeSwap, the tool is designed to improve decentralized finance (DeFi) investment management. 

 CupcakeHop, set to launch in August, aims to make DeFi accessible to a broader range of users with tailored investment strategies and real-time risk management.  

 AI-driven portfolio management  

 In an interview with Cointelegraph, Connor O’Shea, CEO of Bril Finance and the developer behind CupcakeHop, said the AI portfolio management feature automates investment strategies based upon a user-defined goal and real-time market conditions: 

 User-controlled risk management 

 The new tool features a risk engine that will identify and isolate potential risks, automatically rebalancing pools to ensure the security of user-deposited assets. 

 On the topic of risk management, O’Shea speculated the incorporation of a risk management slider element, telling Cointelegraph: 

 When discussing the purpose of such a slider tool, O’Shea explained that it would make “DeFi more approachable, especially for newcomers.” 

 On a more humorous note, O’Shea concluded the discussion of the slider idea by likening the functionality to that of a nuclear weapon's launch sequence: 

 Market accuracy and transparency 

 CupcakeHop aims to address the issue of reporting accuracy by offering users clear and precise information about their investments. 

 Bril Finance’s average monthly trading volume was over $27 million last quarter and $82.6 million in total since late March.

cointelegraph:9aa484c0e094b:0,Ether and altcoin price outlook positive after SEC drops investigation ,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 13:53:49 GMT",Cointelegraph,"Regulators have backed off Ether (for now), which many observers say could give the asset room to grow. 

 On June 19, 2024, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially closed its investigation into whether Ether ETHUSD should be classified as a security.  

 Consensys lawyer Laura Brookover said that crypto markets will see “no more protestations from the SEC that ETH is a security.”  

 However, Carol Goforth, a professor at the University of Arkansas School of Law specializing in business associations and securities regulation, clarified to Cointelegraph that “all the decision means is that at this time, the SEC will not be continuing its investigation. This is not a final determination.”  

 Consensys believes the SEC’s withdrawal from its investigation of Ethereum has removed a significant burden that threatened the network’s survival.Cointelegraph 

 The “momentous” SEC retreat has settled the dust from negative regulatory concerns regarding ETH as a security, but how will ETH’s price react to having a clearer path? The SEC investigation also affected cryptocurrencies with similar attributes to Ether, so which altcoins could benefit from Ethereum’s liberation?  

 Observers say Ether price is set to surge 

 The Ether price has been relatively stable since the SEC stopped its investigation, following a horizontal pattern that has persisted since the news of spot Ether ETF approval on May 23.Cointelegraph 

 At publishing time, Ether is down 2%. This has led some traders to wonder whether ETH will surge and if the altcoin market will follow.  

 Other market observers say there is great potential for future growth. 

 Conor O’Neill, community lead and partner of investment analytics company Blockcircle, told Cointelegraph that “the major regulatory barrier” for Ethereum has been removed and that it “sets a significant precedent for regulators worldwide.” 

 The SEC shutting down the investigation “removes a considerable element of risk and uncertainty for any investors.” O’Neill believes the price of Ethereum is set to surge: 

 There are also other elements to consider. 

 The expected launch of spot Ether exchange-traded funds on July 2 will undoubtedly impact the price of ETH. As was the case when the U.S.-based spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs launched in January, traditional markets are expected to begin injecting capital into the ETFs, producing a higher demand for ETH and boosting its price.  

 O’Neill explained that the ETH ETF “is highly likely to have a long-term positive impact on the price of Ethereum.”  

 Recent: Crypto clicker games need real token use cases to be sustainable 

 In the short term, “we might see a sell-the-news event similar to what we saw when the Bitcoin ETFs were approved.” He said that a short-term pullback should be expected, as some of this news will be priced in when the ETF trading commences. 

 Although the ETH ETF approval is positive news for the crypto markets, Blockcircle’s partner highlighted that the SEC had approved Ether ETFs under certain conditions.  

 ETF issuers cannot offer an Ether ETF with staking. Goforth explained that this is because “the SEC has alleged that staking itself involves an investment contract,” removing the possibility of providing extra gains to its holders.  

 O’Neill believes that if the SEC maintains tight regulatory control over digital assets with total opposition to staking, it could harm ETH’s long-term performance as an institutional asset and, therefore, negatively affect its price. 

 Some have also questioned whether Grayscale outflows, as with the Bitcoin ETF, could affect the Ether price after ETFs launch.Its Grayscale Ethereum Trust, with a valuation over $10 billion, could begin to see major outflows after ETH ETFs launch. This could affect ETH’s price as it did with Bitcoin.  

 O’Neill explained that Grayscale outflows significantly outpaced inflows to the new Bitcoin ETFs because of its higher management fees. 

 However, he highlighted that the Grayscale fee for its Ether trust has been reduced to levels comparable to other Ether ETF providers. 

 In his opinion, this indicates that Grayscale doesn’t want a repeat of the Bitcoin ETF launch and believes that the amount of ETH held by Grayscale “is likely to increase exponentially with the launch of the ETF.”Cointelegraph 

 O’Neill predicted that ETH will “follow a similar trajectory to Bitcoin’s price, with a dip followed by an exponential rise.”  

 However, he noted one central distinction between the Ether ETF and the Bitcoin ETF: the surprise effect of the sudden approval. 

 The price of Ether has a clear path ahead as one of its major opposing fundamental arguments against it has been removed. If ETH surges, will the altcoins follow? 

 Altcoin prices can benefit indirectly  

 When Bitcoin price surges, it creates a lift-up effect for the entire crypto market. Similarly, this occurs in the altcoin market when Ether surges.  

 So, which altcoins could benefit from following the latest news? 

 The SEC halting its investigation may be relevant to other altcoins the agency has accused of being securities.  

 The SEC has opened cases against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase for a variety of securities law violations. The SEC has named several altcoins as securities, including Solana’s (SOL), Cardano’s (ADA) and Polygon’s (MATIC). 

 O’Neill believes that projects such as Aave or Chainlink from the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector or layer-2 chains such as Arbitrum, Optimism or Base could benefit from the SEC’s retreat.  

 Related: SEC drops Ethereum investigation to avoid ‘embarrassing’ court case 

 However, O’Neill remarked that many offer staking capabilities and are not yet entirely free from SEC scrutiny.  

 The SEC’s stance could change drastically as the U.S. presidential election approaches, with Donald Trump advocating for pro-crypto measures.  

 SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s future would be uncertain, as would the regulatory agency’s opposition to staking. Some even speculate that altcoin ETFs could hit the market.  

 The sudden approval of a spot Ether ETFs, the growing number of ETF issuers, and the withdrawal of the SEC’s investigation signal a potential shift in the SEC’s approach. These changes mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market.

u_today:1632c35fe094b:0,Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL) Meme Coin on TON Blockchain Fairlaunched,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 13:53:00 GMT",U.Today,"Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL), an emerging project at the intersection between the two hottest narratives of this crypto сycle - meme coins and the TON ecosystem - welcomes all cryptocurrency enthusiasts to take part in its sale. 

 What is SIMPL, novel meme coin on red-hot blockchain TON: Quick facts 

 With a fully renounced initial token contract ownership, a fancy memetic narrative and a community-centric approach, Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL) might soon be in the spotlight for the TON audience. 

 Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL) leverages the first-mover advantage as the segment of meme coins on TON looks less saturated than that of Solana SOLUSD, and even Base (BASE) or Polygon MATICUSD. 

 What are meme coins? 

 Meme coins (meme cryptocurrencies, meme cryptos) are digital assets inspired by internet memes, jokes or popular culture, often created as a parody or for fun. Typically, such cryptos do not address serious economic or technology challenges. 

 Dogecoin DOGEUSD, a Litecoin (LTC) spin-off from 2013, is known as the first meme coin ever. It started as a joke based on the once-popular ""Doge"" meme, featuring a Shiba Inu dog, Kabosu. Meme coins typically have large supplies and low prices, attracting investors looking for quick profits. They rely heavily on community enthusiasm, social media hype and celebrity endorsements to drive their value. Meme coins gained popularity in 2020 thanks to “TikTok pumps,” coordinated buying and selling campaigns by amateur investors. 

 Shiba Inu SHIBUSD and its numerous copycats should be considered symbols of the meme coin mania that introduced crypto to millions of people in 2021-2024. 

 What is TON? 

 The TON (Telegram Open Network) blockchain is a decentralized platform developed by the team behind Telegram, a popular messaging app. Nikolai Durov, former CEO of Telegram, is a key figurehead of the early TON blockchain. 

 Thanks to its technically advanced infrastructure, TON works faster than traditional L1s and L2s. Its deep integration with Telegram, the world’s most popular messenger, is the killing feature of TON and its dApps. 

 Starting from 2023, the TON ecosystem has been growing exponentially. In April 2024, the world’s largest stablecoin, U.S. Dollar Tether USDTUSD unveiled its version on TON. 

 Why is TON crypto popular? 

 TON is the fastest-growing cryptocurrency ecosystem in 2024. It has attracted a lot of attention and onboarded hundreds of decentralized applications thanks to a combination of factors. 

 Also, TON is known as a developer-friendly and gas-efficient blockchain for mainstream dApps of various types. 

 Introducing Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL), the newest meme coin star on TON 

 Launched in late Q2, 2024, Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL) is attempting to merge the best practices in the segment of meme coins. It is focused on a fun ethos and fair inclusive tokenomics for the mutual benefit of various classes of its ecosystem participants. 

 Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL): Basics 

 Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL) is a meme cryptocurrency on The Open Network (TON), a mainstream L1 blockchain. SIMPL is inspired by the charisma of SpongeBob and Patrick, characters on Nickelodeon’s SpongeBob Square Pants TV series. Image by Simple Ton Coin 

 The team of Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL) explains the idea behind the token’s main narrative as follows: 

 Simple-Ton is a magazine that appears in the episode ""You Don't Know Sponge."" It has a ton of simple things to do, hence the title. It contains a ""How well do you know your best friend?"" quiz. The quiz also has questions like ""Is your friend left or right handed?"" and ""What is your friend's favorite color?"" SpongeBob and Patrick read Simple-Ton to answer questions about each other to see how close they are as best friends. After Patrick gets none of the answers right, SpongeBob is still Patrick's best friend. 

 The token was created using Jetton, a smart contracts framework for digital assets on the TON blockchain. Technically, Jettons are tokens issued on top of TON - not unlike popular ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum ETHUSD and EVM blockchains. 

 Image by Simple Ton Coin 

 The token’s supply is capped at 100 million and cannot be altered in the future. SIMPL initial contract’s ownership was revoked, and its major liquidity shares were destroyed forever to make the asset scarcer and more manipulation-resistant. 

 Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL): Launch date and design 

 Technically, the SIMPL smart contract (EQATbeOJQKUn3Cv8vnrA-5R8X9F-NNsQ05djaSzKmwXwQYkV) was created on June 17, 2024. It means that the corresponding Jetton was deployed to the TON blockchain’s mainnet and became transferable and visible for explorers. 

 Per the documentation portal of Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL), its total supply is capped at 100 million tokens forever. This fixed supply ensures scarcity and helps in maintaining the value of the token over time. 

 Out of this allocation, 2,000,000 SIMPL are reserved for the development team (two pseudonymous developers, Bob and Pat) to ensure continuous improvement and innovation. This allocation supports ongoing development, maintenance and future upgrades of the platform. The rest of the tokens are sent to an independent liquidity pool to ensure that orderbooks on DEXes are protected from enormous volatility and manipulations. 

 Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL): Community 

 The Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL) product is heavily focused on the emerging meme coin community built around the TON blockchain. It has already managed to build a solid presence on X (formerly Twitter) and Telegram, which is the core messenger for the TON ecosystem.

 Representatives of Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL) invite its supporters to join captivating community events and campaigns that are fun and allow the self-expression of Web3 enthusiasts. 

 The token looks like a potentially dangerous competitor to Resistance Dog (REDO), another popular meme coin on TON blockchain that pays homage to Telegram’s Digital Resistance campaign in 2018. 

 Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL): Infrastructure and ambitions 

 Despite being in its infancy, Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL) is already tracked by major analytics instruments in Web3. For instance, SIMPL is listed on CoinMarketCap and automatically browsed by DexTools and DEXScreener, two global on-chain analytics machines.

 Also, SIMPL can already be purchased on-chain, with no need to send funds to a centralized wallet. DeDust.io, an AMM-powered decentralized exchange on the TON blockchain, has listed SIMPL in a pair with corresponding liquidity pool coins. 

 The team of Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL) released a two-phase roadmap to reveal its ambitions to the community. During the first phase, SIMPL contributors will be focused on tech development, DEX listings and community management. The second phase prioritizes influencer marketing, CEX listing and growing the audience organically. 

 Wrapping up: What is special about Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL)? 

 Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL) is the newest meme coin on the TON blockchain and one of the first assets of this type on TON. Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL) was released with a 100 million token fixed supply, its contract ownership revoked, while the lion's share of the supply has been burned. 

 Simple Ton Coin (SIMPL) will benefit from its first-mover advantage and has already established a solid presence on social media.

u_today:abbb0860e094b:0,Warning: Hackers Fake USDT on TON Deposits Amid Binance News,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 13:48:00 GMT",U.Today,"Hackers are currently targeting the USDT on TON blockchain recharge system in an attempt to defraud crypto exchanges with fake deposits. This activity was detected by the Dilation Effect on-chain monitoring system, which discovered a malicious TON address. 

 This entity uses a fake USDT token contract that mimics the official USDT metadata to perform fraudulent recharge tests on various exchanges. 

 Exchanges are advised to implement strict monitoring and verification processes for large deposits of TON chain tokens. Reports indicate that hackers are testing the system with small amounts before attempting larger transactions. This pattern suggests that they are identifying and exploiting weaknesses in exchange deposit protocols.

 Interestingly, the scam activity has emerged amid Binance, the world's cryptocurrency exchange, recently integrating the USDT on TON for deposits and withdrawals. The timing of this scam also raises concerns about the security of TON transactions, especially since many exchanges have only recently started supporting USDT deposits on this blockchain. 

 The issuance of USDT on TON was announced back in April this year. Since then, USDT's presence there has grown significantly, reaching almost $600 million. This growth positions TON as the sixth largest blockchain by USDT volume, with TRON, Ethereum and Solana maintaining the top three. 

 Given this situation, exchanges and users are advised to stay vigilant and monitor any unusual activity.

financemagnates:e510a8d7d094b:0,Taiwan's BitoGroup Collaborates with Digital Bank for Crypto-Friendly Accounts,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 13:47:24 GMT",Finance Magnates,"Taiwan's cryptocurrency company, BitoGroup, has partnered with Far Eastern International Bank to introduce crypto-friendly bank accounts that integrate users' bank accounts with their cryptocurrency wallet to facilitate transactions. This collaboration aims to enhance the way users transact digital wallets.  

 Linking Crypto and TradFi 

 According to the press release, this partnership bridges the gap between traditional banking and cryptocurrency and offers users a better and reportedly secure platform. This offering is a product of research and development conducted over a three-year period that saw the integration of the systems of both companies. 

 The new account can reportedly be linked to BitoPro's exchange account and set up within about an hour. Positive feedback from the pilot phase revealed a 25% increase in daily transaction amounts per user, indicating strong community support and interest. 

 By integrating traditional financial systems with cryptocurrency exchanges, BitoGroup aims to create a trustworthy and secure environment for transactions. The partnership is expected to spur further innovations and enhance the flexibility of using both fiat and cryptocurrencies. 

 Besides that, BitoPro has collaborated with Neweb Technologies, Taiwan's largest third-party payment processor, to launch ""BitoPay."" This solution allows 300,000 merchants and millions of users to make payments using cryptocurrency, making it the most widely accepted crypto payment method in Taiwan.  

 VASP Association 

 The crypto industry in Taiwan is reportedly gaining traction with the establishment of the Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) Association, where Titan Cheng, BitoGroup's founder and CEO, has been elected as the first Chairman. This collaboration between cryptocurrency and traditional financial institutions seeks to gain the trust of regulatory authorities and strengthen the foundation of the crypto-financial system. 

 Last year, Taiwan's crypto industry created an industry association in collaboration with its financial regulator. This move preceded the release of the official guidelines for the sector. To expedite the process, nine cryptocurrency firms formed a working group, expressing their intention to apply for the formation of an industry association by mid-October last year.  

 Since 2021, Taiwan has mandated VASPs to follow strict anti-money laundering laws provided by the Financial Supervisory Commission. However, beyond these AML regulations, the broader cryptocurrency industry in Taiwan has operated mainly without formal oversight. Thus, the FSC announced plans to provide comprehensive guidelines about cryptocurrency trading and payments for VASPs last year.

u_today:5144c61f4094b:0,SEC v. Kraken: Key Takeaways From Latest Court Session,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 13:45:00 GMT",U.Today,"A prominent legal expert known as ""Metalawman"" on X provided an update on the recent SEC v. Kraken hearing, which took place in federal court in San Francisco. 

 Yesterday, an oral argument was held on Kraken’s motion to dismiss the SEC’s enforcement action. Kraken’s dismissal motion focuses on Howey and contends that the SEC failed to plead that any securities transactions occurred on the Kraken platform. 

 Kraken garnered lots of amicus support for its motion, with Senator Lummis, Blockchain Association, DeFi Education Fund, Chamber of Digital Commerce, Investor Choice Advocates Network, Paradigm and two admin law scholars filing briefs. 

 SEC v. Kraken Hearing Update. 

 The hearing on Kraken's motion to dismiss just concluded in federal court in San Francisco. 

 Before any argument, the Judge declared he was inclined to follow the rulings of Judges Rakoff & Failla--and deny the motion to dismiss. 

 I don't think he…— MetaLawMan (@MetaLawMan) June 20, 2024 

 The recently held court hearing, which centered on Kraken's motion to dismiss, concluded with a notable declaration from Judge William Orrick. Before any arguments were presented, Judge Orrick stated his inclination to follow the rulings of Judges Rakoff and Failla, indicating a likely denial of Kraken's motion to dismiss. 

 Metalawman observed that the arguments made during the hearing did not seem to sway Judge Orrick's initial mindset. This development implies that the Kraken case might likely proceed to years of costly discovery, akin to the ongoing Ripple case. 

 Adding a layer of historical context, Metalawman noted that Judge Orrick's uncle served as a commissioner of the SEC in the 1950s. This familial connection to the SEC adds an interesting dimension to the judge's current role in the case. 

 The decision to deny the motion to dismiss might suggest that Kraken could face an extended legal battle with the SEC, entailing significant resources and prolonged scrutiny. As the case unfolds, it will be closely watched by the cryptocurrency community and legal experts, given its potential implications for the regulatory landscape of digital assets.

beincrypto:f3746b2d0094b:0,Crypto Analyst Explains Why Meme Coin Supercycle is Here to Stay,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 13:41:15 GMT",Beincrypto,"In 2024, meme coins emerged as the most dominant sector in the crypto market. According to a CoinGecko report, it was one of the most profitable sectors in the first quarter of 2024.  

 Meme coins have drawn both retail and institutional investors. The sector’s popularity has grown with the participation of celebrities like Andrew Tate and Iggy Azalea. 

 Why Meme Coins Are Popular? 

 These coins usually experience explosive growth followed by significant retractions. However, the pattern changed in 2024. 

 Sherpa remarked that Meme coins have transitioned from being a fleeting trend to a leading sector this year. Traditionally, technology-driven projects led the market. However, meme coins like Dogwifhat (WIF), BONK, and PEPE are now in the spotlight, surpassing more technical altcoins in attention and investment. 

 “Memes in isolation are always going to be present. You’re always going to have one crazy meme doing big numbers at all times in the industry; that’s probable. But I’m more talking about the entire meme coin sector greatly outperforming everything else as a regular occurrence for long durations, similar to what we have seen in 2024,” Sherpa stated. 

 He believes that meme coins’ appeal lies in their simplicity and accessibility, which makes them easy to understand and trade and contributes to their popularity. 

 “Memes have a much lower barrier to entry for retail participants, very similar to 2021 NFTs in that regard. Why ask someone to understand modular blockchains or chain abstraction when you can simply buy a picture of a dog with a hat?” Sherpa questioned. 

 Moreover, liquidity for meme tokens has surged, with the market depth hitting an all-time high of $128 million in early June, according to Kaiko. This increase is due to both price appreciation and a rise in transaction volumes. 

 Despite their popularity, Sherpa also highlighted the risks associated with meme coins, including high scam potential and insider manipulation. These factors could impact market dynamics unfavorably. Nonetheless, he advocates for including meme coins in diversified investment portfolios. 

 He suggests that investors diversify their portfolios by including meme coins alongside established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin BTCUSD and Ethereum ETHUSD. 

 On the other hand, Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, offers a contrasting view. He observed a decline in meme coin dominance and hinted at a broader shift in the crypto community’s focus.  

 The debate on meme coins’ future continues to divide opinion. While some analysts see them as a lasting element of the crypto sector, others predict a pivot back to traditional investment strategies.

coindesk:461d71635094b:0,Bitcoin Slumps Under $64K Amid Historic ‘Negative’ Sentiment,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 13:24:40 GMT",CoinDesk,"Bitcoin's {{BTC}} slow bleed lower over the past weeks has sped up Friday, the price dipping more than 3% in the past 24 hours to slide to about a five-week low of $63,700, now lower by 9% over the past month. 

 Contrarian bulls, however, might take comfort as indicators tracked by analysis firm Santiment show that crowd sentiment for BTC is now in its fourth week of “extreme negative” reading. 

 “The crowd is mainly fearful or disinterested toward Bitcoin,"" the firm said in an X post Friday. ""This extended level of FUD is rare, as traders continue to capitulate,” they added. ""BTC trader fatigue, combined with whale accumulation, generally leads to bounces that reward the patient."" 

 Santiment’s Weighted Sentiment Index measures bitcoin mentions on X and compares the ratio of positive to negative comments and trading volumes to gauge what the crowd is generally feeling about bitcoin. The index, which shows a -0.73 reading as of Friday, has been negative since May 23. 

 Elsewhere, data from Google Trends shows a decline in retail search interest. The tool allows users to compare the relative volume of searches. A line trending downward means that a search term's popularity relative to other popular terms is decreasing. Worldwide searches for “bitcoin” have steadily fallen since March 2024, data shows. 

 BTC prices have generally suffered in the past few weeks amid $1 billion in sales from large holders, dollar strength and a strong U.S. technology index market that may be drawing investor money. 

 Outflow activity from U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has also reached its worst since late April, with $900 million leaving the products so far this week. These figures are nearing the $1.2 billion in total net outflows in trading sessions from April 24 to May 2. 

 Some traders expect bitcoin to reach the $60,000 level in the near-term due to the lack of growth catalysts, although the long-term outlook remains bullish, as previously reported.
