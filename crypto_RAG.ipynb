Currently, data indicates that the Korean won accounts for 2.12% of BTC settlements, making it the second most popular fiat currency for BTC transactions after the U.S. dollar.

The founder of the onchain and market data platform Cryptoquant has noted that the bull run is at its midpoint and suggests that if this trend persists, “the bull cycle might end by April 2025.” The timing of the bull run remains a mysterious and highly debated topic. Predictions about its onset, current status, and conclusion are constantly made and speculated upon. Currently, BTC is trading at $66,900, showing a 10% increase in value against the U.S. dollar over the past week. This price is approximately 10% below the all-time high of $73,794 per unit, reached on March 14, 2024. Some believe that the peak has already been reached and no further highs are expected, while others argue that the six-digit price zone is within close reach. On May 17, Ki Young Ju explained that the bull run is at its midpoint range. “Bitcoin is in the middle of the bull cycle,” the Cryptoquant CEO said. “Its market cap is growing faster than its realized cap, a trend that typically lasts around two years. If this pattern continues, the bull cycle might end by April 2025.” While the price experienced some stagnation, many still believe the bull cycle is ongoing. This week, onchain analyst Willy Woo observed that profit-taking has concluded. “Bitcoin [Spent Output Profit Ratio] (SOPR) update. Profit taking has completed, it took 2 months,” Woo said. “A very healthy reset, against a backdrop of capital flows into the network climbing again.” Whether the experts are correct about the current stage of the bull cycle is uncertain. The trajectory of bitcoin’s price still remains unclear, with varied opinions on the bull run’s status. Some indicators point to a possible peak, while others imply potential for further growth.

In comparison, most other cryptocurrencies are much further from their ATHs, with many alternative crypto assets still having a significant journey ahead to reach their former peaks.  Several crypto assets have outperformed BTC over the last 90 days. However, in the current bull market, BTC has maintained an advantage over many of its rivals. For example, out of the $2.35 trillion crypto economy, BTC’s market cap stands at approximately $1.28 trillion, accounting for over 54% of the total market value. BTC achieved its ATH 64 days ago, reaching $73,794 per unit on March 14, 2024. With a current price of $65,368 per coin, BTC is now 9% below the peak recorded two months ago. Ethereum (ETH), in contrast, is 36.6% below its ATH of $4,878 per coin, which was reached on Nov. 10, 2021. BNB has performed better, being 13.4% below its peak from May 10, 2021. Although BNB hasn’t surpassed its ATH in three years, it remains closer than most. Solana (SOL) is down 34.4% from its ATH of $259.96 per coin, recorded on Nov. 6, 2021. XRP’s decline is among the steepest, down 81.4% since its ATH on Jan. 7, 2018. Toncoin (TON) is a recent addition to the top ten and is down 11.7% from its $7.63 ATH reached last month on April 11, 2024. Rounding out the top ten, dogecoin (DOGE) is down 77% from its ATH, and cardano (ADA) is down 84.8% from its peak.

This 7.1% increase against the U.S. dollar propelled bitcoin past the $66,000 threshold, reaching a peak of $66,461 per coin on Bitstamp. Consequently, the entire cryptocurrency market rose by 6.2%, resulting in the liquidation of 51,567 traders on various crypto derivatives exchanges over the course of the day. Bitcoin has climbed 7.1% relative to the dollar, surpassing the $66,000 mark at 3:45 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on Wednesday. At that current time, bitcoin’s price hovers at $66,300 per unit, with the past 24 hours seeing a global trading volume of $34 billion. From the day’s lowest price, bitcoin’s value has increased by more than $4,200 during the trading sessions. This recent upturn further marks a 5.2% rise over the past seven days against the greenback. Bitcoin’s initial uptick on Wednesday followed the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics’ release of the consumer price index (CPI) report. On May 15, bitcoin’s primary trading pairs included USDT, FDUSD, USD, USDC, and KRW, with the Korean won comprising 2.36% of bitcoin’s global trades. While the global weighted average price of bitcoin stands at $66,300 it traded at $67,632 on the South Korean exchange Upbit at 3:45 p.m. (ET) as well. The day’s substantial price rise across the entire crypto economy led to significant trader liquidations, with 51,567 traders being wiped out today. Over the last 24 hours, derivatives positions amounting to $127.98 million were liquidated, including $83.39 million in crypto short positions. Specifically, $45.94 million of those positions were bitcoin shorts and $17.88 million of ethereum (ETH) shorts were also liquidated. Additionally, $6.27 million in PEPE shorts were liquidated throughout the day. This latest bitcoin price uptick, driven by a favorable CPI report, catalyzed a wave of liquidations, predominantly affecting those on the wrong side of leveraged positions. As $127.98 million in derivatives were cleared off the table, the event underscores the high-stakes nature of leveraged crypto trading where significant price movements can either forge fortunes or obliterate investments in mere moments.

The report highlights bitcoin’s resilience and ethereum’s comparative lag in speculative interest and price performance. Glassnode researchers noted a significant divergence in performance between bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH), with BTC showing stronger resilience. “Ethereum’s under-performance this cycle relative to bitcoin is reflected in a measurable lag in speculative interest from the short-term holder cohort,” the latest Glassnode onchain report states. This divergence has been attributed to a weaker capital rotation trend for ether compared to past cycles. The report further details that the fourth Bitcoin halving initially led to a sell-off, with BTC prices falling to $57,000 before recovering. “Measured from the [$73,000 all-time high], bitcoin prices corrected by -20.3%, which is the deepest correction on a closing basis since the FTX lows in Nov-2022,” Glassnode stated. In contrast, ether experienced a similar drop but suffered a maximum drawdown twice as severe as BTC’s. Glassnode researchers highlighted that despite the initial sell-off, both BTC and ETH showed signs of recovery. However, ethereum’s price performance continued to lag behind bitcoin. The researchers noted, “For ethereum, we continue to see ongoing HODLing behaviour, particularly in the 1 to 3-year cohorts,” indicating a wait-and-see approach from seasoned holders due to ETH’s current under-performance.  Investor behavior also differed between the two assets. Bitcoin’s net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) metric crossed into the euphoria phase three months earlier than ethereum’s, reflecting a faster expansion of unrealized profits among bitcoin holders. Glassnode’s analysis suggests that the disparity in performance and investor sentiment is likely influenced by the approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which has not yet been mirrored for ethereum.

As of May 11, Bithumb ranks within the top 25 globally, positioned at 22nd. Upbit reported approximately $1 billion in trade volume over the past day, whereas Bithumb registered about $298.23 million. The South Korean won remains the second most traded fiat currency against BTC, trailing the U.S. dollar, with around 2.07% of all BTC transactions conducted in won, followed by the euro, yen, and pound. As South Korea‘s bitcoin market stabilizes, the narrowed premium reflects a landscape where traders are possibly becoming more aligned with global pricing trends. Despite a significant drop from its peak, the persistent, albeit reduced, premium indicates a strong demand for bitcoin within the country. With the South Korean won maintaining its strong position in the global bitcoin trade, it highlights the nation’s continued prominence in the crypto economy. The dynamics between local and global prices will likely continue to evolve, reflecting broader trends in the crypto market. What do you think about the bitcoin premium in South Korea?

The price of bitcoin (BTC) increased by 4.5% against the U.S. dollar on Friday, rebounding from last week’s decline when it fell beneath the psychological $60,000 mark. Despite this 4.5% rise over 24 hours, BTC prices remain 4.3% below their level from seven days prior. After stabilizing for nearly two days, the upward movement of BTC began at 8 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on Friday. At that time, BTC prices were hovering just above the $59,000 mark. However, a boost in buying activity elevated the price to a daily high of $62,109 by 11 a.m. (ET). Bitcoin has accounted for approximately $33.28 billion of the crypto economy’s total $89.19 billion trading volume. This increase in Bitcoin’s price led to a significant number of short traders on derivatives markets being eliminated. Metrics from Coinglass.com indicate that $26.65 million in bitcoin short positions were liquidated within a four-hour period. ETH shorts experienced a $16.93 million loss, while $4.51 million in SOL short positions were removed from the market.

Global trading volumes on spot crypto exchanges have remained subdued, and in the past day, derivatives exchanges saw $271 million in both short and long positions liquidated. Bitcoin (BTC) fell to a Tuesday low of $59,629 on Apr. 30, but swiftly recovered, surpassing the $60,000 mark. To date in 2024, BTC has successfully ended the day above $60,000 for 61 days. A closure below this level would end its longest-recorded streak above this price point. Data reveal that spot trade volumes on numerous centralized exchanges were reduced in April compared to March. Specifically, trading volumes for bitcoin and ether alone have significantly declined since mid-April. Currently, BTC is trading between $60,450 and $60,950 as of 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time on Apr. 30, 2024. It has contributed approximately $31.43 billion to the total $89 billion global trade volume recorded across the entire crypto economy in the last 24 hours. Ether transactions account for about $16.2 billion of this total. Recent data on derivatives liquidations show that $271 million in positions were eliminated yesterday. In total, 95,167 traders faced liquidation, with the majority—$212.4 million—comprising long positions, and $60.58 million in short positions. Of the long positions, $83.78 million were in ETH, while $66.61 million were tied to BTC-centric bets. As the crypto economy navigates through these choppy waters, the enduring demand for bitcoin, coupled with the strategic movements of traders, suggests a cautious optimism in the face of current market uncertainties. The close of the month may prove crucial in determining the trajectory of its long-standing price stability. In a communication to Bitcoin.com News, Etoro market analyst Simon Peters observed that “crypto price movements were fairly muted last week.” He also pointed out that BTC prices have retreated following net withdrawals from spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “We’re still waiting for any significant volatility post-halving, however, the longer price stays around these levels, holding above the $60,000 mark, the stronger the narrative could become that support has formed and a move to the upside is more likely,” the analyst remarked.

Despite this dip, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index remains firmly in the “greed” sector. According to Google Trends, interest in the term “bitcoin” has diminished, while the market intelligence firm Santiment reports an uptick in BTC sell signals. This weekend, bitcoin (BTC) remains confined within a specific range. BTC/USD charts indicate a “neutral” status across most oscillators, and the majority of moving averages suggest a continuation of the bearish outlook. On Saturday, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index (CFGI) hosted on alternative.me revealed that the sentiment of “greed” is still prevalent with a score of 69. Typically, a greedy sentiment in the CFGI suggests that the market could undergo a correction.  BTC has also experienced its longest period in 2024 with bitcoin’s value remaining over $60,000, lasting approximately 58 days. Post-halving, however, interest in bitcoin appears to be waning, as evidenced by Google Trends data, which shows a decline in searches for “bitcoin” from a high of 80 out of 100 on April 19 to a current score of 30. The downturn in interest began around April 21, based on 90-day statistics from Google Trends. Yet, related searches continue to probe for an unprecedented price high, with queries like “bitcoin all-time high” and “ATH bitcoin” appearing frequently in GT’s related queries list. On Friday, the market intelligence firm Santiment reported a noticeable increase in “sell calls” on social media, indicating a heightened push for selling BTC. “Bitcoin’s price dropping as low as $63.4K has crypto traders spooked, as buy calls across social media are low and sell calls are peeking in at an increased rate,” Santiment posted on platform X. “When this level of FUD begins to sneak in, market recovery probabilities increase,” concluded Santiment’s market analysts.  On the other hand, QCP Capital’s weekend brief notes that interest could pick up when Hong Kong’s spot bitcoin and ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launch next week. “There is a potentially positive catalyst next week as the [Hong Kong bitcoin and ethereum] spot ETFs begin trading,” QCP Capital said. “Interest is growing in what could be a gateway for the inflow of Asian institutional capital.” What do you think about the state of bitcoin markets this weekend and going forward into next week?

With a detailed analysis of market conditions and future outlooks, FDA’s research report provides several predictions for short and long-term trends. Fidelity Digital Assets (FDA) Research starts the quarter with a nuanced look at bitcoin’s (BTC) performance, which saw a notable 64% increase by mid-March, slightly trailing behind ether’s 74%. Despite a slight retraction, the market conditions remain buoyed by the approval of several spot bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs). Alongside this FDA researchers attribute some of the market strength is due to a persistent decrease in BTC’s supply on exchanges. The FDA report further examines selling pressure within the crypto markets, highlighting that currently, this pressure originates from bitcoin miners. “Bitcoin began 2024 playing catch-up to ether’s run of 74%, stopping just short at 64% mid-March,” the report explains. “Since then, bitcoin has retraced 2% while ether has fallen roughly 19%. The high fee environment has subsided, but increased spot prices combined with the 2024 halving continue to incentivize miners to take profits. Therefore, miners remain a notable portion of the current sell pressure.” On ethereum’s (ETH) front, the report highlights the successful Deneb-Cancun upgrade which has been a boon for ether’s fundamentals, leading to a 55% price increase in Q1. The researchers say that the Ethereum network now boasts a higher burn rate than issuance post-Merge, enhancing its deflationary status. This, coupled with an 8% increase in validator numbers, strengthens the network’s long-term health, according to the FDA study. The FDA’s findings emphasize the role of technological improvements and regulatory changes in shaping market dynamics. The adoption of layer two (L2) platforms post-Deneb-Cancun upgrade is particularly notable, making up about 80% of ether transactions and contributing to a significant reduction in transaction fees. In addition, the FDA researchers claim that BTC is not cheap and the group has changed its overall outlook from “positive” to “neutral.” The report states: Mid-Term (1–5 years) bitcoin is no longer ‘cheap’ and is considered to be trading at ‘fair’ value. Long-term ([greater than] 5 years) overall condition: NEUTRAL. Looking forward, Fidelity Digital Assets’ analysis indicates a measured optimism. The report observes that although the markets have demonstrated robust growth in Q1, market participants should stay alert to possible selling pressures and corrections. It concludes that the continuous rise in staking is likely to impact market dynamics further, presenting an engaging period for both existing participants and newcomers to the cryptocurrency markets.

The following is a look at several popular runes tokens, detailing their supplies and present market values. Since the introduction of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin has seen significant tokenization efforts. Numerous tokens emerging from the Bitcoin blockchain are now actively traded and hold real-world value. One way to gauge the value of some of these tokens is through Okx’s non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, which features listings for Ordinals and BRC20s. Post-halving, runes have shown increased trading volumes alongside elevated and unfathomable market caps. For example, the Runes-based Z•Z•Z•Z•Z•FEHU•Z•Z•Z•Z•Z token, we’ll refer to as Z•FEHU, is trading at 25,999 satoshis or $17.21 per token. The day prior, on April 20, Z•FEHU traded for 64,999 satoshis or $42 per token. This token was created during the halving at block 840,000 and has a circulating supply of 110,010,564 Z•FEHU, with 110,000,000 tokens premined and 19,780 mints at 7:00 a.m. (EDT) on Sunday. According to Okx, 3,885 holders possess Z•FEHU, and there have been 216 sales in the marketplace so far. At the current price, the fully diluted valuation of Z•FEHU would be approximately $2.07 billion. Another token featured on Okx from the Runes protocol universe, referred to as RSIC•GENESIS•RUNE, or simply RSIC, has logged 686 sales to date, with a base price of 19.6 satoshis, equivalent to $0.012 per token at 7:00 a.m. (EDT). This puts RSIC’s fully diluted valuation at an ostensible $267.37 million. Yet, RSIC has a total supply of 21 billion tokens, all premined by the sole creator. Given the novelty of runes tokens and their limited liquidity compared to more established cryptocurrencies, market valuations can be extraordinarily high and may fluctuate significantly, especially in nascent markets where liquidity is still developing. Another trending Runes-based token, SATOSHI•NAKAMOTO, which we will call SN, has already achieved 5,293 sales. According to Okx, 19,862 holders currently possess SN. This token boasts a total supply of 21,169,700, with 4,200,000 of these being premined. Amid trading volume amounting to $2.8 million, SN is currently trading at 9,550 sats or $6.21 per coin, bringing its market cap to approximately $132.3 million on Sunday morning. Additional Runes-based tokens that are active on Okx include ‘MEME•ECONOMICS,’ ‘THE•TICKER•IS•ELSA,’ ‘RARE•PUPS•PUPCASH,’ ‘UNCOMMON•GOODS,’ and ‘ANARCHO•CATBUS.’ These new tokens are attracting buyers for various reasons—from their provenance and speculative potential to their links with existing BRC20 and Ordinal projects. While it’s too soon to predict the future demand for Runes-based tokens, enthusiasts are optimistic about the significant value rise of this emerging economy. While some are sure to view the recent trend as a passing phase. So far, the impact and spread of runes tokens have certainly left a profound impression.

This pivotal change coincides with a notable fluctuation in price, demonstrating a complex interplay of supply and demand forces at work. Currently, bitcoin is trading at $64,488, down 4.5% this week, with an intraday range stretching from $63,161 to $64,968. The 1-hour and 4-hour charts depict a market teeming with instability and rising buying interest. Specifically, bitcoin’s (BTC) 1-hour chart shows a significant price spread from $61,885 to $65,506, ending recently with a vigorous uptick that signals increasing purchase activities. On the other hand, the 4-hour view supports a bullish stance with ascending lows and a fresh uptrend, pointing to strong buying interest that may continue to propel prices higher, though traders should watch for potential retracements. A review of the daily chart reveals a notable rebound from a recent low of $59,629, with current trends marked in green, indicating a bullish projection for the long term. Astute crypto traders might find opportunities if the price revisits and sustains the $59,629 level as support. However, they should be ready to strategize exits around the $72,756 threshold if signs of price resistance appear, suggesting a possible decline. Market oscillators mostly indicate a neutral stance, with the relative strength index (RSI) at 47, and other metrics like the Stochastic and commodity channel index (CCI) mirroring this equilibrium. This neutrality in oscillators recommends traders leverage a cautious wait-and-see tactic. Moving averages (MAs) deliver a divided outlook, with shorter durations (EMA and SMA for 10 and 50 days) hinting at bullish prospects, whereas longer periods (20 and 30 days) imply selling pressures, highlighting the market’s uncertainty post-halving. Presently, BTC bulls are attempting to break the $65,000 range and hold it. Given the resilience of Bitcoin prices post-halving and the strong buying signals evident on both the 1-hour and 4-hour charts, there is a credible case for optimism. If the market maintains support at $59,629 and continues to exhibit bullish behavior, we could foresee an upward trajectory toward previous highs. Despite the current bullish indicators, the substantial rise in transaction fees following the halving poses significant concerns. Coupled with mixed signals from moving averages and a general trend of neutrality from oscillators, there is a substantial risk of a market downturn. If Bitcoin fails to hold key support levels and faces resistance near its recent high, this could trigger a bearish reversal, potentially leading to a downward correction in prices.

The cryptocurrency experienced a 7.7% decrease within three hours, triggered by a flurry of panic selling that started at 1:00 p.m. Two-week statistics indicate that bitcoin has fallen 8.7% compared to the U.S. dollar, while trading volume soared to $41.63 billion throughout the day.  Around 4:15 p.m., the price stabilized, cooling down to just above the $62,000 mark with several attempts to climb into the $63,000 range. In total, over a three-hour span, bitcoin lost $4,500 in value despite some recovery. Hourly liquidations from long positions in bitcoin alone saw $167.13 million wiped out, with Saturday’s total liquidations across the cryptocurrency landscape nearing the $1 billion mark again. At 4:15, the 24-hour liquidation tally stood at $697.07 million, with $598.91 million from long positions. By 4:25, bears had pushed BTC’s price back under the $62,000 mark, triggering additional leveraged liquidations. Throughout the day, 219,299 traders faced liquidation. This spike in selling pressure could potentially push BTC prices even lower, perpetuating a cycle that hastens the decline. Often, such rapid sell-offs are driven more by emotional responses than by thoughtful analysis, leading more traders to sell off in a bid to minimize losses.

Glassnode’s 13th weekly 2024 onchain analysis indicates a strategic shift among bitcoin investors as the digital asset reached a new peak, with long-term holders beginning to realize profits. The report shows a significant $2.6 billion per day in realized profits, highlighting a common response to reaching resistance levels at new ATHs. This trend aligns with historical patterns observed in previous cycles, where similar behaviors were noted among the investor cohort. “This price action aligns very closely with the prior 2018-21 cycle,” the report explains. “By both duration and distance from the April 2021 peak, the market is in a near identical spot to December 2020 relative to the 2018-21 cycle.”  The firm’s in-depth review provides insights into the market’s reaction to bitcoin’s price movements, noting a 15.4% pullback from the $73,794 peak before a strong recovery.

This milestone will see mining rewards on the network notably reduced from their current levels. Currently, Bitcoin Cash ranks as the 15th largest by market capitalization among over 10,000 cryptocurrencies, having risen 91% against the U.S. dollar over the last month. Expected to kick off around April 4, 2024, the reward halving on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain will decrease mining incentives from 6.25 BCH to 3.125 BCH at block 840,000. Presently, the network finds itself at block 839,044. As the halving looms, Bitcoin Cash has experienced a substantial 32% increase against the greenback over the past week and 91% over the preceding month, thereby enhancing the BCH hashprice. This adjustment has rendered BCH mining 0.2% to 0.4% more profitable than mining BTC. The impending halving and the resultant rise in hashprice have spurred an increase in the network’s hashrate, which has doubled in the past 90 days. According to the seven-day simple moving average (SMA), the total hashrate of Bitcoin Cash has fluctuated between 5 and 7 exahash per second (EH/s) over the past day. The network is currently supported by 30 mining pools, with Viabtc at the forefront, commanding a rate of 671.65 petahash per second (PH/s). Other leading mining pools include Millpools, Solopool, F2pool, and Trustpool. Following this halving event, in 47 days, the network is poised for its next update on May 15, 2024. This update is anticipated to implement CHIP 2023-04 Adaptive Blocksize Limit Algo. As detailed on gitlab.com, this algorithm is projected to have minimal impact on the existing dynamics and incentives within the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. The algorithm will maintain the current 32 MB cap as the base “stand-by” value, with any increases by the algorithm seen as additional capacity supported by actual transaction volume. As the Bitcoin Cash community stands at the cusp of these pivotal changes, the focus shifts to how these developments might shape the future of BCH. With the halving and impending upgrade, the network’s resilience and adaptability are under test. These events could potentially redefine the economic and mining landscape of BCH, influencing its position in the broader cryptocurrency market.

The next Bitcoin halving, set for mid-April 2024, is poised to slash miner rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, a change that has historically influenced the asset’s value and investor strategy. This halving marks the fourth of its kind, continuing Bitcoin’s design to limit inflation by decreasing the supply of new coins entering circulation. As with previous halvings, this event is anticipated with a mix of speculation and analysis, with Coinbase Institutional offering a detailed comparison to the cycle spanning 2018 to 2022, highlighting a 500% gain from its cycle low.  Analyzing past halvings, Coinbase reports varied outcomes post-event, with the first halving in 2012 leading to a significant 923% price surge in the following six months. However, subsequent halvings showed moderated yet positive impacts on bitcoin’s price, underlining the unique circumstances surrounding each event. Despite these historical uptrends, Coinbase advises caution, emphasizing the speculative nature of extrapolating past performance to predict future outcomes. “Investors should be cautious about accepting this view at face value,” Coinbase researchers detail. The report adds: While it’s possible that the halving could have a positive impact on bitcoin’s performance, there’s still only limited historical evidence about this relationship, making it somewhat speculative. The report also sheds light on the broader macroeconomic factors influencing bitcoin’s price, such as monetary policies and fiscal stimulus measures. Notably, the anticipation around spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the potential easing of Federal Reserve policies are highlighted as significant contributors to recent price rallies, suggesting that halvings are just one of many factors that can sway BTC’s market dynamics. Onchain analytics, as presented by Coinbase’s report, offer another lens through which to view the halving’s potential impacts. Long-term holder (LTH) behavior and supply dynamics provide insights into market sentiment and the foundational shifts that may arise from the halving event. The high supply in the hands of LTHs, coupled with decreasing trends post-ETF introductions, paints a complex picture of supply and demand influences on bitcoin’s future price.

In the countdown to Bitcoin’s much-anticipated halving, the crypto community is abuzz with speculation and strategic recalibration. Glassnode, an onchain analytics company, has dissected the impending halving, juxtaposing it against the burgeoning influence of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on bitcoin’s liquidity and price dynamics. The study suggests that the conventional wisdom surrounding halvings as bullish harbingers may need reevaluation in this cycle, presenting a novel scenario for traders to navigate. Historically, halvings have been viewed through a bullish lens, primarily due to their design to slash the rate of new BTC generation by half, thereby instituting a form of digital scarcity. This event traditionally led to a reduction in sell pressure from miners, fostering an environment ripe for price appreciation. However, Glassnode’s research indicates a departure from this pattern, with ETFs now playing a pivotal role in shaping bitcoin’s supply and demand equation. The sheer scale of bitcoin acquisitions by ETFs is posited to potentially offset the halving’s scarcity effect, suggesting a nuanced trading landscape ahead. “The significant buying power of ETFs is set to overshadow the traditional supply squeeze effect expected from the halving,” Glassnode’s onchain report details. “This dynamic introduces a need for traders to balance the historical impact of halvings with the contemporary influence of ETFs on bitcoin’s availability and price.” A significant facet of the report focuses on the influence of long-term holders (LTHs) on BTC’s market dynamics. Glassnode emphasizes the criticality of monitoring the Long-Term Holder Market Inflation Rate, a metric indicating LTHs’ net accumulation or distribution of bitcoin. This metric serves as a bellwether for understanding shifts in market sentiment and liquidity, crucial for traders aiming to finesse their strategies in alignment with the evolving market structure. Glassnode’s study states: It shows the annualized rate of bitcoin accumulation or distribution by LTHs relative to daily miner issuance. This rate helps identify periods of net accumulation, where LTHs are effectively removing bitcoin from the market, and periods of net distribution, where LTHs add to the market’s sell-side pressure. Addressing the psychological underpinnings of the market’s reaction to halvings, Glassnode explores the concept of the halving as a potential “sell-the-news” event. Drawing on historical precedents, the report suggests that the immediate aftermath of halvings can be fraught with volatility, underscoring the importance of strategic foresight in trading decisions. Glassnode’s analysis beckons traders to brace for potential market corrections, which could recalibrate speculative interests and chart the course for the next growth cycle.  What sets this cycle apart, according to Glassnode, is the unprecedented pre-halving price rally and the dynamic interplay between ETF demand and the traditional halving narrative. The report advises traders to adopt a multifaceted approach, balancing the historical significance of halvings with the contemporary market forces at play, including ETF activities and the strategic positioning of LTHs. This holistic perspective may be instrumental for navigating the unique contours of the current BTC market cycle, ensuring traders can adapt and thrive in an environment where old paradigms are being redefined.

On Monday, insights from QCP Capital indicated a notable interest in long-term September and December bitcoin calls, aiming for the lofty six-figure price brackets. Just last week, bitcoin (BTC) achieved its highest price point to date on March 14, 2024, hitting $73,794 per coin. Trading platforms in the spot market have witnessed considerable trading volumes, and the bitcoin derivatives market has similarly experienced substantial expansion. Bitcoin futures are maintaining open interest at all-time highs, with options on bitcoin also surpassing previous records. Essentially, a BTC futures contract commits parties to trade bitcoin at a predetermined future date and price, locking them into the agreed price irrespective of future market values. In comparison, bitcoin options contracts offer buyers the choice, but not the requirement, to trade bitcoin at a set price by a specified deadline, providing greater flexibility and potentially limiting losses to the option’s premium cost, unlike the obligatory nature of futures. On Monday, a report from QCP Capital’s broadcast channel described the weekend as dominated by “both fear and greed,” leading to a drop in bitcoin value to $64,500 lows. Despite this decrease, the firm observed a positive turnaround and emphasized investor eagerness to “buy the dip.” Additionally, QCP’s update pointed out the activity in the bitcoin options market, with ambitious forecasts now becoming commonplace. “We also continue to see buying interest in long-dated [September and December bitcoin] calls targeting $100-150,000,” stated the Singapore-based cryptocurrency company on Monday. Ethereum presents a contrasting scenario, according to QCP, attributed to market concern over ETH due to unfavorable perpetual contract funding rates and a negative skew in risk reversals, indicating that traders might be investing in short positions in anticipation of a price decline. “The market is very nervous about [ethereum’s] price cracking in spite of the continuing rally in alts,” QCP mentioned on Monday.

Despite these significant gains, a considerable number of individuals are of the opinion that this upward trend is just beginning. Yet, the exact start of this crypto bull market is still up for debate. Bitcoin (BTC) has climbed to unprecedented price levels this year, igniting widespread speculation and all types of forecasts. On March 12, 2024, Philip Swift, the founder of lookintobitcoin.com, disclosed bitcoin’s MVRV Z-Score on X, indicating that the metric suggests the bull market’s upward momentum may just be beginning to pick up steam. “MVRV Z-Score is now at 2.82,” Swift posted. “Useful context to see how far through the bull cycle we might be. Still a long way to go,” he added. Predictions have abounded during BTC’s rise, with call options targeting the $100,000 per unit benchmark. Onchain analyst Willy Woo recently remarked that the current jump in bitcoin’s value is merely “the warm-up.” The cryptocurrency trader and analyst, who goes by the name Rekt Capital on X, delved into historical price trends with greater detail. “Historically, bitcoin has peaked in its bull market 518-546 days after the halving,” the analyst explained. “However, Bitcoin is showing clear signs of acceleration in its current cycle by approximately ~260 days. This therefore may cut the typical cycle length in half.” The trader suggested that if we determine the peak of a bull market from the point an old all-time high is surpassed, then this viewpoint implies bitcoin could reach its bull market zenith 266-315 days after it eclipses its previous all-time high. “Bitcoin broke to new all time highs in this cycle last week,” Rekt Capital concluded. “If the accelerated perspective turns out to be true, then the next bull market peak may thus occur in 266-315 days. That’s December 2024 or February 2025.” Currently, market sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, with individuals like Rekt Capital, Plan B, Woo, and Swift, among many others, employing indicators, pricing models, and historical patterns to forecast the bull market’s direction.

As of Monday, March 11, 2024, bitcoin (BTC) achieved a new zenith, hitting $72,372 per coin, establishing a fresh peak in its price history. This price milestone has catapulted BTC to become the world’s eighth-largest asset by market cap, overtaking silver’s total valuation. Bitcoin’s market capitalization now floats around $1.41 trillion, slightly above silver’s market value of $1.38 trillion. In recent times, BTC has methodically surpassed the market capitalizations of leading global entities, including TSMC, Berkshire Hathaway, and Meta (previously known as Facebook). However, bitcoin still trails behind gold, which boasts a market capitalization of $14.7 trillion. BTC now represents 9.59% of gold’s total market value. The leading digital currency is nearer to the market caps of Microsoft at $2.99 trillion and Apple at $2.67 trillion.

In its analysis, Glassnode emphasizes the notable entry of institutional funds into bitcoin (BTC), especially after the green light for U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This influx, contrary to the doubts of critics, has boosted bitcoin’s value, reaching $70,000 last week—a 58% leap from its $42,800 value before the ETF approval. The report by Glassnode reveals a pivotal transformation in the bitcoin market, characterized by a rise in miner rewards from $22 million to $49 million daily, alongside alterations in exchange flows in the lead-up to and following the sanction of U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs. Prior to the ETF approvals, exchange flows were inconsistent. However, following the approval, a steady demand emerged, evidenced by a daily withdrawal of $17 million, according to Glassnode’s findings. In parallel, U.S. spot BTC ETFs recorded an average daily net inflow of $299 million. Consequently, this led to a daily net capital influx of around $267 million into bitcoin, clarifying the market’s surge toward unprecedented highs. “Overall, this represents an on-balance, and back-of-the-envelope net capital inflow into bitcoin of around $267M/day (−49+17+299),” Glassnode explains. The report adds: This represents a meaningful phase shift in market dynamics and a valid explanation for the market’s rebound towards new [all-time highs]. Glassnode’s analysis further explores the behavior patterns of long-term holders, who have increased their market presence as BTC nears record-breaking levels. This activity aligns with patterns observed in past cycles, hinting at a calculated reaction to the market’s upward trajectory and possibly signaling the onset of a new peak in the market cycle.  With BTC prices inching closer to their peak levels, long-term investors, currently holding an average unrealized gain of approximately 228%, have begun to intensify their selling activities. Nonetheless, Glassnode’s onchain analysts point out that this phase of selling by long-term holders has only persisted for 42 days to date, implying that incoming demand could counterbalance these selling pressures for several more months if past trends serve as a reliable benchmark.

Evidence indicates that call options, with strike prices ranging from $80,000 to $100,000, are now in the mix, as speculators exhibit strong optimism. Global data from Google Trends in the last three months shows that the search term “bitcoin” reached a peak score of 100 on March 5. This surge in curiosity is coming from diverse nations, with the majority of related subjects and topics linked to the term focusing on “exchange-traded fund.” On the social media platform X, the topic “bitcoin bull market” has likewise hit peak levels. Tuur Demeester, the editor-in-chief of Adamant Research, offered his insights on Friday. “I think we’re gearing up for an epic bull market in bitcoin,” Demeester said. “Just like in the most aggressive cycles in the past (2012 & 2015), we are seeing very minimal price drawdowns. In other words, supply is low and dips are getting bought aggressively.” Numerous bitcoin enthusiasts echo similar views, and many have cautioned against potential downturns that might materialize during the bull run. The X account known as The Bitcoin Therapist conversed about these sorts of price adjustments that could occur. “Last bull market, bitcoin had 13 corrections of 10% or more from $3,800 to $69,000,” the bitcoin proponent wrote. The social media account with nearly 86,000 followers added: You thought we were going to get to $500K without a few dips? Intelligent money is pouring into bitcoin and no one knows how high this thing is going. Act accordingly. In recent weeks, much speculation has emerged, and well-known price models have made a comeback. A particular price model suggests that bitcoin (BTC) could potentially hit the $1 million milestone by adhering to specific Power Law corridor lines and maintaining a steady growth rate. In a CNBC interview, Pomp Investments’ Anthony Pompliano said he believes bitcoin could double soon. Onchain analyst Willy Woo thinks the bull is just warming up. According to a Bloomberg report, call options are also witnessing wagers in the $80,000 to $100,000 bracket. Citing figures from Amberdata, the report highlights that 12% of open interest is leaning towards these predictions. “Open interest is still sky high and there’s still rampant speculation,” noted Zaheer Ebtikar, founder of the cryptocurrency fund Split Capital, in the report.

Over the last day, statistics reveal an open interest of $32.30 billion across fourteen distinct bitcoin futures markets. Friday, March 8, 2024, marked a notable day when BTC soared to a new peak price of $70,184 per coin at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Although the price later declined, the bounce back was quicker compared to the substantial volatility bitcoin witnessed on March 5. The latest crypto rally has triggered a noticeable increase in open interest for crypto futures, particularly in bitcoin. Data indicates a total of $32.30 billion in open interest recorded in the last day, with CME Group at the forefront. CME Group leads with $10.07 billion in volume, followed by Binance with approximately $7.21 billion. Bybit and Okx have reported $4.88 billion and $3.18 billion in open interest, respectively, over the last 24 hours. The leading three markets have also experienced increases in open interest in the same timeframe. Currently, bitcoin’s 24-hour open interest represents 48.2% of the $67 billion total across all crypto economy futures. For example, on Friday, ETH futures markets saw $13.24 billion in open interest, and SOL futures reached about $2.50 billion. There have also been significant liquidations of long and short positions over the past week. In the last 24 hours, as BTC approached the $70K mark, the entire crypto economy saw $311.76 million in liquidations. Of this, $152.71 million were long positions, and $159.02 million were short, with $96.89 million of this total stemming from BTC short positions, which were eliminated over the past day.

Currently, bitcoin boasts a global trading volume of $52.34 billion, contributing to the total $275 billion exchanged throughout the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Bitcoin’s ascent beyond the $69,000 mark was short-lived, as its value swiftly descended upon reaching this new peak. Records indicate that BTC’s pinnacle price hit $69,210 on Bitstamp. The most frequently traded pairs against BTC were USDT, FDUSD, USD, and USDC, with the South Korean won ranking as the fifth most popular trading pair with bitcoin on Tuesday. Following this peak, a considerable sell-off ensued, driving BTC down to $59,772.   In correspondence shared with Bitcoin.com News, Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, weighed in on this latest pricing achievement. “Bitcoin’s price often reaches new highs that are not just small bumps, but large leaps beyond the previous records,” Nazarov remarked. “This suggests that we may be at the beginning of a new positive market cycle for bitcoin. When bitcoin’s price surges, it attracts more capital to the ecosystem, which fuels innovation and development within the space.” Nazarov noted that at the same time, we’re witnessing a fusion of macroeconomic factors underpinning bitcoin’s growth. The co-founder of Chainlink elaborated that a blend of global economic trends, regulatory progress, and market shifts is aligning with the introduction of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Nazarov added: These ETFs are more than investment tools; they’re bridges linking traditional finance with the crypto world, broadening bitcoin’s appeal and accessibility. This convergence of supportive macro factors and the innovation and capital within the bitcoin ecosystem is creating a reinforcing loop and setting the stage for bitcoin’s continued ascent in the financial landscape. Data reveals that in the last four hours, $179 million worth of BTC long positions have been liquidated across bitcoin’s derivatives markets. Despite the significant 10% decline following the all-time high, the cryptocurrency community remains optimistic. The breach of the all-time high has sparked a wave of even loftier forecasts for bitcoin’s value, with speculations of it reaching six-figure sums flooding social media platforms and discussion forums like Reddit. This trend of bullish optimism aligns with a quote by Satoshi Nakamoto, suggesting the power of collective belief in shaping financial futures. “It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy,” Nakamoto remarked in 2009. What do you think about bitcoin’s price high and the large drop that followed?

Over the past year, bitcoin’s value has swelled by 196% and has risen by 157% over the last six months when measured against the U.S. dollar. At the time of writing, the leading crypto asset is nearing the $67,000 mark.  With the network halving drawing near, fewer than 7,000 blocks remain, and the value of bitcoin against the dollar has significantly increased. On Monday, March 4, 2024, BTC hit a new 2024 high, climbing to $66,851 at 11:13 a.m. (ET), moving well past the $64,000 peak achieved just five days prior on Feb. 28. After jumping past the $66K range, BTC has surpassed the market capitalization of the social media powerhouse Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook). BTC is now ranked the ninth largest asset globally by overall market capitalization.   Today, bitcoin’s trading volume stands at approximately $52.84 billion, contributing to the global crypto economy’s 24-hour trade volume of $156 billion. However, this volume falls short of tether’s (USDT) 24-hour volume on Sunday, which amounts to $86 billion. USDT ranks as bitcoin’s primary trading pair, with the first digital usd (FDUSD) following as the second most significant trading pair for bitcoin. Subsequent to FDUSD, the most prevalent trading pairs for bitcoin include USD, USDC, KRW, EUR, TUSD, and GBP, rounding out BTC’s top eight trading pairs. Although bitcoin has revisited the $66,000 level, on South Korean exchanges such as Upbit and Bithumb, it commands a premium, trading at $69,166 per unit. Currently, BTC’s value is a mere 4% shy of its all-time peak of $69,044 per unit, achieved on Nov. 10, 2021. It’s quite possible that the value of BTC could soon equal the value of a kilogram of fine gold, which amounts to 35.27 ounces, with BTC’s current worth at 32.6 ounces. It’s important to remember that during BTC’s upward trends, drops ranging from 20-30% are not uncommon. Clearly, bitcoin has enjoyed a steady ascent over the last 140 days, with only minor declines observed. The digital currency did experience a notable 20% decrease after momentarily reaching $49K, coinciding with the approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, marking its first significant downturn since mid-October 2023.

Naturally, as bitcoin’s value escalates, its duration above such thresholds shortens when contrasted with past significant milestones such as $30,000, $40,000, and $50,000. Throughout its history, Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced several significant uptrends, notably in 2013, 2017, and 2021. The 2021 uptrend was particularly notable for its double peak, with bitcoin’s price hitting two zeniths, forming a unique pattern that precipitated a reversal in its trajectory. This bull run is also memorable for BTC eclipsing its 2017 peak of $20,000 per unit, with the cryptocurrency’s value soaring to an all-time high (ATH) of $69,044 per coin on Nov. 10, 2021. Before the ascent to $60,000 in 2024, BTC’s price had breached the $60,000 mark for a cumulative 40 days in 2021. Nearly three years to the date, bitcoin’s value first reached $61,200 on March 14, 2021, but it remained at this level for only one day. By April 12, the momentum returned, pushing the price over $60,000 for a span of six days. It wasn’t until October 2021 that BTC’s price would once again climb above $60,000, achieving this milestone on Oct. 16. The final occasion that year when BTC exceeded this price point was 835 days ago, on Nov. 18, 2021. Since its inception by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, the Bitcoin network has been active for a total of 5,538 days. After surpassing the 2017 milestone, BTC’s value has been recorded over the $20,000 mark for 1,053 days, which accounts for 19.01% of its existence. The currency has stayed above $30,000 for 670 days or 12.09% of its life, and above $40,000 for a total of 420 days. As bitcoin’s value escalates, the duration at these elevated levels diminishes, with the price being over $50,000 for 163 days. This indicates that throughout bitcoin’s lifespan, it has been priced above $50,000 for 2.94% of the time and above $60,000 for merely 0.81% of its existence. Bitcoin’s current upswing could potentially evolve into a scenario featuring multiple zeniths, possibly marking another double or even triple peak against the U.S. dollar. Since Feb. 28, BTC has successfully stayed over $60,000 so far, though the duration of this trend remains uncertain. Should BTC surpass its previous all-time high (ATH) of $69,044 and breach the significant $70,000 milestone, it would enter a phase of price discovery, highlighting the market’s new valuation of bitcoin. Nevertheless, speculation persists, notably from JPMorgan’s analysts, regarding a possible descent beneath the $60K mark. The U.S. bank’s market analysts anticipate a decline to $42K following the halving event. What do you think about the future of bitcoin’s price trajectory?

This upward trend is attributed to the anticipated halving event, set to happen in 16 days, and the forthcoming 2024 upgrade, which is expected to implement an adaptive block size limit algorithm. Over the weekend, bitcoin cash (BCH) saw its value against the U.S. dollar soar by more than 40%, and over the past month, it has surged by 88%, significantly outpacing BTC’s 30-day increase. Currently, BCH boasts a market capitalization of $8.71 billion, trading at $444 per unit after briefly touching $451 in the early trading hours of Saturday. As of 9:30 a.m. on Saturday, bitcoin cash ranks 11th in trading volume among the 10,000+ cryptocurrencies over the last day. Tether (USDT) holds the position as the most traded pair with BCH, accounting for over 53% of all BCH transactions. The South Korean won follows as the second most traded pair, representing more than 28% of BCH trades on March 2. Notably, BCH trades at a premium in South Korea, with an average price of $467.75, compared to the global average of $444 per coin. Other significant trading pairs for BCH this weekend include the USD, BTC, and USDC. Several factors have contributed to BCH’s substantial appreciation in value over the last month, notably the imminent halving and the subsequent upgrade scheduled for May. The Bitcoin Cash network is set to undergo a halving before BTC, with the BCH halving projected to take place on or around April 4, 2024. Post-halving, BCH miners will see their rewards per block cut from 6.25 BCH to 3.125 BCH. In the last 24 hours, BCH miners have committed an average of 6.44 exahash per second (EH/s) of SHA256 hashrate to the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. A forthcoming event in BCH’s timeline is the annual May fork, which aims to transition from a 32-megabyte (MB) block size limit to an adaptive block size limit algorithm. “This upgrade resolves an economic vulnerability that was introduced in 2010 and led to the BCH/BTC network split in 2017,” says BCH developer Jason Dreyzehner. He further elaborates: The algorithm automatically adjusts Bitcoin Cash’s block size limit to reduce infrastructure costs during periods of lower usage while enabling up to a doubling of the maximum block size per year at peak growth. This update will succeed the May 15, 2023, Cashtokens upgrade, which ushered in capabilities for smart contracts and onchain tokenization. Advocates of BCH are enthusiastic about the subsequent adaptive block size limit adjustment post the April halving event. “It’s now less than 100 day[s] until the BCH Jessica upgrade,” Mathieu Geukens remarked on X on Feb. 8. “Bitcoin Cash gets an adaptive blocksize limit algorithm, this innovation finally solves the discussions about when and by how much to change the maximum network throughput.” What do you think about the rise in bitcoin cash’s value this weekend?

Speculation centers on the exact moment this upward trajectory began, given that bitcoin has appreciated by 46% since the start of the year and 139% over the previous six months in comparison to the U.S. dollar. Plan B, the architect behind the stock-to-flow (S2F) valuation model, suggests that bitcoin’s “accumulation phase has ended.” He posits that, should history serve as a guide, we might witness “10 months of face melting FOMO.” Following a prolonged and challenging crypto winter, and even with bitcoin’s value climbing to the $64,000 range, there remains skepticism about whether the bull cycle has indeed begun. Furthermore, the pressing question on everyone’s mind is pinpointing the exact start of the bull run and the duration it might sustain. The topic has taken center stage on social media platforms, with numerous individuals engaging in discussions about the bullish cycle. “The bull run is back,” the X account Evan Luthra wrote. “After years of wait[ing], finally market is going to the moon. Bitcoin recently surged past $60k for the first time since 2021. With the next Bitcoin halving only 50 days away, [and] many experts predict we are at the start of a new bull run that will reach its peak in late 2025.” Another individual called ‘Trader Tardigrade’ posted on X and said, “Bitcoin consolidating in triangles is getting shorter in time in each cycle. The impulsive bull run remains the same though.” Moreover, the individual behind the bitcoin valuation framework known as stock-to-flow (S2F) has increasingly referenced his model in recent discussions on the social media platform X. In a specific post on X, Plan B stated, “Bitcoin Feb closing price: $61,181 … back to S2F model value.” On Friday, Plan B expanded on his insights regarding the bull market cycle. “Red dot,” Plan B wrote. “Accumulation phase has ended: no more easy buying opportunities in orderly and slowly increasing markets.” The pseudo-anonymous S2F creator added: Bull market has started. If history is any guide, we will see ~10 months of face melting FOMO: extreme price pumps combined with multiple -30% drops. Enjoy! Plan B’s views and the S2F price model have sparked debate in the past, particularly at the onset of the crypto winter when outcomes diverged from S2F forecasts. In response to Plan B’s post, Taproot Wizard Eric Wall mentioned he blocked the author in order to freely express his criticism. Wall shared an S2F image of an S2F chart and said, “Let’s forget that ‘red dot’ are supposed to track the months until halving, with the first red dot starting right after the halving … Except the red dot can be repurposed to whatever new meaning gets the most likes I guess?” In the unpredictable realm of cryptocurrency, the quest to accurately predict the start and finish of a bull run proves to be a formidable challenge. Despite fervent discussions and analytical models like S2F attempting to chart the course, the reality remains that pinpointing peaks can be elusive. Bitcoin’s trajectory could ascend beyond expectations, yet overt greed may lead to losses if ambitious price targets falter. The crypto market, with its inherent volatility, teaches a lesson in cautious optimism, underscoring the complexity of forecasting in an ever-evolving financial landscape.

This upward trend in value has stimulated bitcoin-based derivatives, causing open interest in bitcoin futures to hit an unprecedented level, exceeding past records set in both 2021 and 2017. Bitcoin (BTC) derivatives have witnessed a significant uptick in terms of open interest and overall volume in bitcoin futures since mid-October 2023. Open interest (OI) in derivatives markets is defined as the total number of unsettled derivative contracts, such as futures, that remain active. Essentially, it serves as an indicator of the influx of capital into the bitcoin derivatives market. At present, the open interest figures for bitcoin futures have reached an all-time high (ATH) of $24.44 billion as of Feb. 27, 2024. The latest ATH surpassed the OI recorded the day before BTC hit $69K per unit in November 2021, with $23.06 billion reported on the 9th. The record set on Feb. 27 also exceeded the OI reached on April 13, 2021, which was just shy of the record at $24.27 billion, or a mere $170 million lower than Tuesday’s peak. Similar to other market signals, the measurement of bitcoin futures OI can offer insight into trader sentiment. Generally, when OI is increasing, the trend is typically bullish, and when OI is decreasing, the trend leans toward bearish sentiment. CME Group leads the bitcoin derivatives market in terms of futures open interest (OI) with 137,550 BTC, equivalent to $7.77 billion, and commands a sizable 31.79% of the total market share on Tuesday. Binance follows closely in second place with 108,280 BTC or $6.13 billion in OI, and Bybit takes the third spot with $4.10 billion. Okx is also a significant player in the market with $2.47 billion in bitcoin futures OI. Other prominent exchanges in terms of BTC futures OI include Bitget, Bingx, and Deribit. In addition to the strong performance of bitcoin futures, bitcoin options OI has also been notably high. Although the current figure has not surpassed the BTC options OI recorded in December 2023, it has already exceeded the highs of April and November 2021.

This leading crypto asset has witnessed a growth of 4.5% in the last six hours, and over the previous month, bitcoin’s value has soared by 28.3% against the U.S. dollar. For the first time since 2021, Bitcoin’s (BTC) has breached the $54,000 mark, reaching a peak of $54,564 at 2:28 p.m. on Monday. With its current price, bitcoin’s market capitalization is smoothly sailing at $1.06 trillion, accounting for 51.2% of the $2.06 trillion total crypto economy. Now ranked as the world’s tenth largest asset by market capitalization, BTC is slightly below Meta’s total valuation of $1.23 trillion. As of 8 a.m., bitcoin’s trading volume stood at $14.57 billion, which has escalated to $24.59 billion by mid-afternoon. Bitcoin’s trading volume constitutes 32.32% of the $76.06 billion total 24-hour trading volume across the crypto market on Monday. A detailed look at a four-hour span reveals that $37.4 million in bitcoin short positions were liquidated as prices vaulted from $53,000, and then to $54,000. The last instance when bitcoin’s price was above the $54,000 mark was on Nov. 28, 2021. Currently, bitcoin’s value is merely 21.5% shy of its peak price of $69,044 per unit, recorded on Nov. 10, 2021. This upward trajectory aligns with the anticipation surrounding the imminent Bitcoin network’s reward halving, set to occur in less than two months. Historically, bitcoin has experienced significant price appreciation in years marked by a halving event, and 2024 appears to be continuing this trend.

Bitcoin’s meteoric rise over the past day triggered a wave of liquidated leveraged positions, wiping out $89.28 million in short positions.  After the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the new spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), bitcoin (BTC) prices rocketed to $49K then plummeted to a low of $38,500 on Jan. 22, 2024. Since then, BTC has steadily climbed in value. Over the past two weeks, BTC has surged 21% against the U.S. dollar, propelled by two key factors. At 10:05 a.m. on Wednesday, BTC tapped the $52K mark and currently rests just under that threshold. First, the new spot bitcoin ETFs have attracted billions in inflows since launching. Blackrock and Fidelity’s offerings in particular have seen massive inflows, breaking 2024 records. The nine newly introduced ETFs have offset outflows from older funds like Grayscale’s flagship GBTC. In short, the ETF’s enormous demand for the already scarce bitcoin (only 900 mined per day) has pushed prices up. The latest data from Coinshares reveals that spot BTC ETFs have attracted a staggering $4 billion in net inflows. In the latest Alpha Report by Bitfinex, analysts believe investor confidence is growing, and crypto asset inflows have sparked significant new demand. “Investor confidence in Bitcoin is rising, as evidenced by the rise in BTC at the end of last week,” the Bitfinex report details. “We attribute the gain in part to the slowdown in selling of Grayscale’s GBTC funds, and a significant uptick in total crypto asset inflows. Indeed, Bitcoin holdings of the new BTC ETFs are now larger than Microstrategy’s holdings and we expect flows to continue.” The report adds: These inflows, coupled with the impending 2024 Bitcoin halving and the sustained high levels of illiquid supply – with more than 70 percent of BTC in the hands of long-term holders – paint an exceptionally bullish picture for BTC price movements. The second major driver is bitcoin’s upcoming fourth halving event, which will cut its block reward in half from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC after April 19, 2024. Only 9,567 blocks remain until this milestone, which will reduce the daily bitcoin supply from 900 to around 450. Halvings make the already scarce bitcoin even more limited in supply historically causing its value to climb. Tuesday’s price drop below $49K after the U.S. CPI report has erased massive short positions from derivatives markets. Per Coinglass.com, over $89.28 million in BTC shorts and $39.47 million in ETH shorts were liquidated over the last day. Meanwhile, open interest in bitcoin futures has reached new highs and the aggregated open interest in BTC options has been rising as well.

The leading digital currency by market cap swiftly reached $50,000, marking a 3.7% increase over the past day and a notable 15.6% rise throughout the week. Over the past week and the month leading up to it, bitcoin (BTC) has seen an impressive 16.7% uptick since Jan. 12, 2024. By 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Monday, Feb. 12, it vaulted over the $49K barrier. Just 45 minutes later, it momentarily hit $50,000 per unit on Bitstamp, only to retreat slightly after encountering stiff resistance.  Within a brief span of 60 minutes, a staggering $25.57 million in BTC short positions were wiped out as the price soared. Currently, bitcoin’s market cap is near $979 billion, representing 52.9% of the entire crypto market. Leading trading pairs for BTC on Monday included USDT, FDUSD, USD, USDC, and KRW.   In South Korea, bitcoin’s spot market value is trading even higher, breaching the $50K mark with a premium price of $50,665 per unit on Bithumb, compared to its global rate of $49,856. Other South Korean platforms such as Upbit and Korbit mirror these elevated rates. The current level of BTC’s valuation hasn’t been observed since December 2021, surpassing 800 days, with the exception of a brief spike to $49K on Jan. 11, 2024. With its current price at $49,856, BTC is just 28.3% shy of its peak at $69K, recorded on Nov. 10, 2021. It still remains the tenth most significant asset globally by market cap, trailing Meta’s $1.212 trillion valuation. Bitcoin’s current worth significantly outstrips its value from the same period last year, when it was trading between $21,500 and $22,500.

On Sunday, the leading digital currency maintained its robust momentum, consistently staying above the newly established price level. Over the last 24 hours, the crypto asset’s value has risen by over 2.6%, and it has gained more than 12% relative to the U.S. dollar in the past week. Bitcoin (BTC) has shown remarkable performance this week against the U.S. dollar, climbing from the $43K bracket to its present $48K valuation. In the last day alone, BTC has hit a peak of $48,601 per unit, encountering significant resistance in the $49K-$50K zone. As of 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, global BTC trade volume has reached approximately $19.71 billion. With BTC priced at $48,307 each, its market capitalization is a mere $51 billion shy of the coveted $1 trillion milestone, standing at $949 billion.   An examination of bitcoin’s 1-hour and 4-hour charts reveals a consolidation period after its recent approach to $49K, indicating an ongoing equilibrium between demand and supply forces. Despite facing a ceiling of $48,601, the prevailing market optimism is still evident, marked by a pattern of ascending lows and highs. This resilience underscores a robust foundation of support, setting the stage for potential future price increases. Currently, indicators such as the relative strength index (RSI) remain in a neutral zone yet echo positive sentiments seen in the momentum and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators. The coherence between exponential (EMAs) and simple moving averages (SMAs) across different timelines reinforces the bullish outlook, suggesting an enduring positive trajectory. Surpassing the $48K threshold triggered a significant wave of liquidations among bearish traders, as detailed by the analytics on coinglass.com. In the last day, short positions in BTC worth $28.91 million were unwound. Bitcoin’s price is buoyed by a confluence of factors, including its increasing acceptance, heightened interest from institutional investors, and anticipation of the forthcoming halving event. Both the daily transaction volumes and the network’s computing power have soared to unprecedented levels. The surge in institutional attention and the market’s bullish sentiment toward bitcoin have been key in sculpting its price landscape. The influx of heavyweight institutional players and the rising investments into spot bitcoin ETFs reflect a deep-seated trust in bitcoin’s future. This surge of institutional activity, alongside an upbeat market environment, supports a positive forecast for bitcoin’s path. Adding to this momentum is the anticipated network halving, set to occur in just 69 days, a period historically associated with substantial price increases for BTC.

The firm’s latest report notes that this regime typically signals a pivotal phase often preceding the onset of bull markets, where long-term investors begin to see a return to profitability.  Glassnode‘s latest Risk Assessment Framework study introduces a nuanced approach to understanding bitcoin’s (BTC) market cycles through onchain data. By analyzing short-term and long-term risk cycles, the framework offers a data-driven model to gauge drawdown risks. The entry into a high-risk regime, as detailed in the report, marks a critical juncture typically observed at the commencement of bull markets. This phase is characterized by increased profitability for long-term investors, reflecting a growing confidence in the market’s future trajectory. “As such, ‘High-Risk’ is defined as a point where the market is likely in a speculative bubble,” Glassnode’s research explains. “By contrast, ‘Low-Risk’ environments are considered those where much of the speculative excess has been cleared, and the market is more likely to be within a bottom formation pattern.”  At the core of Glassnode’s analysis are metrics like the MVRV Model and Mayer Multiple, which together delineate the market’s current risk status. These indicators highlight the deviation of bitcoin’s price from its long-term averages, presenting a methodical way to identify speculative bubbles and bottom formations.  The Glassnode researcher, known as Cryptovizart, says the recent elevation of these metrics into the high-risk category underscores the speculative nature of current market conditions, yet it historically aligns with the early stages of market recoveries. Additionally, the report emphasizes the role of investor behavior, particularly through the Percent of Supply in Profit and Net Unrealized Profit/Loss metrics. These indicators provide insights into the potential for increased selling pressure and the overall sentiment of greed or fear among market participants. The current positioning within the high-risk domain suggests a cautious optimism, with a significant portion of the market holding coins accumulated at lower price points during the previous consolidation phase. By assessing spending patterns and demand for block space, Glassnode further identifies shifts in market dynamics that precede major price movements. Currently, the high-risk indicators highlight an environment ripe with speculation, yet buoyed by a solid foundation of long-term investor profitability and renewed market activity. While caution remains paramount, the analysis underscores the inherent optimism among long-term investors, suggesting a strategic moment for market entry. “These risk factors consider a wide set of data and investor behavior categories, helping to establish a framework for analysts and investors,” Glassnode’s report concludes. “Whilst each indicator can be used individually, the combination often provides a more comprehensive picture of the state of the market.” What do you think about Glassnode’s study on bitcoin entering the high-risk regime?

On Thursday, bitcoin’s price climbed over 4% against the U.S. dollar, and hit a peak of $45,522 per unit. Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a positive surge on Thursday, breaking free from its two-week-long consolidation phase. The value of the leading cryptocurrency, as gauged by market capitalization, has broken through the $45K barrier, achieving a peak of $45,522 per BTC. This marks its highest price point since it last touched $49,048 about 27 days prior, on Jan. 11, 2024. Interestingly, this previous peak coincided with the day when ten spot bitcoin ETFs were launched on the U.S. stock exchanges.   Before that noteworthy day, BTC approached the $48K mark on Jan. 8, and a week earlier, its value hovered near the $46K level. Each of these peaks was fleeting, as sell-off pressures quickly drove the price down from those heights. Following the inaugural trading day of the ETFs, when BTC hit the $49K threshold, it sharply fell to the $41,500 range the next day. Additionally, from Jan. 11 to the present, BTC dipped to a low of $38,505 per coin on Jan. 23. This indicates that, over the last 16 days, BTC has seen a value increase of more than 16% against the U.S. dollar.

In the past month, the index has consistently been in the realms of “greed” and “extreme greed.” Specifically, on Jan. 9, 2024, a surge in BTC’s price resulted in the highest reading of “extreme greed” on the Crypto Fear and Greed Index (CFGI) since 2021. As recently as last week, the CFGI remained in the “greed” territory, registering a score of 56 out of 100. This sentiment persisted into yesterday with a slightly lower score of 55 out of 100, still within the “greed” category. However, the index for Sunday, Jan. 28, 2024, recorded a score of 54 out of 100, categorizing the day as “neutral.” The CFGI evaluates market sentiment by analyzing factors like volume, market momentum, volatility, dominance, social media, and other trends. On Bitstamp’s BTC/USD chart for Sunday, there was a significant peak at $42,824. Post this spike, the price began a consolidation phase, characterized by smaller fluctuations and reduced volume, indicating a state of equilibrium in the market following the recent increase in the crypto asset’s value.

Present data reveals that a substantial 14,292.18 bitcoin, valued slightly above $556 million, exited the fund after Monday’s trading activities. Recent figures indicate a notable decrease in Grayscale’s spot bitcoin ETF holdings, declining from 566,973.40 BTC on Friday to 552,681.22 BTC currently. This reduction highlights that the fund’s most recent outflow is its largest to date, with 14,292.18 BTC, equivalent to $556 million, departing from the trust. Since Jan. 12, 2024, GBTC has seen its reserves diminish from 617,079.99 BTC to its present level, a loss of roughly 64,398.77 BTC, now valued at just over $2.5 billion. On Jan. 22, the trade volumes for spot bitcoin ETFs reached $2.09 billion, with GBTC volume contributing $1.08 billion to this total.

In a similar vein, Fidelity’s Wise Origin spot bitcoin ETF, known as FBTC, now boasts a holding of 30,169.54 BTC. Grayscale’s outflows and the declining value of bitcoin have sparked widespread discussion on social media platforms. Bitcoin’s price has slid below the $39K threshold. Etoro’s market strategist, Simon Peters, commented on Monday morning that a portion of GBTC’s outflows can be attributed to investors migrating towards options with “lower fee alternatives.” Concurrently, xs.com’s market analyst, Antonio Ernesto Di Giacomo, pointed to bitcoin miner outflows as contributing to the downturn. In a note sent to Bitcoin.com News, Blockguard CEO Anthony Bevan emphasized that retail investors should remain calm during the correction. “Retail investors need to be aware that large players in the market will always try to manipulate prices, this is done to flush out sellers’ lower price, and more often than not the big player will buy back in,” Bevan explained. “The important thing you is to stay calm and where possible DCA (dollar-cost-average) into your investment.” Bevan additionally emphasized that predicting the duration of this downturn is an uncertainty. “However in my opinion, we will see a strong wick down to liquidate longs with bounce and slight recovery so that we find a range again, once we find a new range, we will have a better idea of where the market would go next,” the Blockguard executive added.

Following its dip under the $40K barrier on Monday, the leading crypto asset further depreciated by 5.3% relative to the U.S. dollar within the last 24 hours. In terms of its market value, bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed more prosperous times. After breaching the $40,000 level on Jan. 22, it has now descended below $39,000. On Tuesday, bitcoin’s value hit a nadir of $38,600, marking a 5.3% decrease in a single day and a 9.8% reduction over the week. Over a two-week period, bitcoin has depreciated by 16.8% in comparison to the greenback.   The current downturn in bitcoin’s price is rife with speculation, particularly concerning Grayscale’s GBTC outflows and the notion of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) being a “sell the news event.” In a note shared with Bitcoin.com News, Etoro’s market analyst, Simon Peters, discussed the prevalence of GBTC’s recent outflows. “GBTC from Grayscale still holds the most bitcoin of any of the spot ETFs with 53% of the market share, however, this was all acquired from its days as an investment trust, before it made the conversion to an ETF,” Peters said on Monday. “GBTC since becoming an ETF has actually seen net outlaws totaling 66,500 BTC (around $2.6 billion at current market prices) in all likelihood due to the high fees prompting investors to switch to lower fee alternatives.” The analyst added: The approval of the bitcoin spot ETFs has proved to be a ‘sell the news’ event. Since the ETFs went live on 11th January the bitcoin price is down 16% with some long-term holders banking profits. Besides the GBTC outflows, xs.com‘s market analyst, Antonio Ernesto Di Giacomo, shared with Bitcoin.com News that additional elements might also be influencing the situation. Di Giacomo says that the price growth of more than 90% in less than a year has possibly led to “massive sales [that] could have knocked down the price.” Furthermore, the analyst pointed out that miners might be contributing to some of the prevailing pressure. “Another factor that could have contributed to bitcoin’s collapse, today, could be that miners started selling their bitcoins as it happened a few months before the May 2020 Halving,” Di Giacomo wrote. “This event, which will occur in April 2024, is the process that reduces the rewards for mining bitcoin. Faced with the possibility of changes in the value of the digital asset, miners take advantage of good price opportunities to accelerate their liquidations and this oversupply could push the price down,” the analyst added.

Concurrently, gold’s value decreased by a percentage point and bitcoin also witnessed a decline, dropping 1.02% in relation to the U.S. dollar. Market sentiment remains wary regarding the U.S. Federal Reserve’s strategies for 2024, with anticipation growing around a potential rate cut by March. This outlook comes in the wake of remarks made by Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller during an address at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Waller acknowledged the possibility of a rate reduction occurring within the year, yet emphasized that the Fed is not in a hurry to initiate this change. “I see no reason to move as quickly or cut as rapidly as in the past,” Waller said. In a predictable turn of events, 10-year Treasury yields saw a 0.98% increase on Wednesday, following a 4.4% rise over the past month.

The day concluded with most funds slightly over 1% lower against the U.S. dollar, with Grayscale’s GBTC capturing the lion’s share of the trading volume. This downturn in trading vigor was evident when compared to the initial two days for the nine newly introduced spot bitcoin ETFs, along with the recently converted GBTC ETF. Market data revealed that the total trading volume for the ten U.S.-focused spot BTC ETFs amounted to a total of $1.94 billion. The day prior saw $3.15 billion in global trade volume and to date, $9.63 billion has been recorded across all three days of trading. GBTC and Blackrock’s IBIT dominated the trading volume, with GBTC registering a significant $1.01 billion and IBIT recording $372.31 million. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) experienced substantial trading as well, with $322.82 million, while Ark Invest and 21shares’ ARKB ETF observed $124.52 million in trades. This means, out of the ten spot bitcoin ETFs, those four equated to $1.83 billion or 94.32% of the day’s volume. At 11:59 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, in the afternoon, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, remarked on the trading volume. He observed that it demonstrated a “dropoff rate” similar to that of BITO, describing BITO as “the most successful organic launch in ETF history.” Meanwhile, bitcoin prices have been rangebound over the last few days since the ETFs launched with bitcoin (BTC) down 1.2% on Jan. 17, 2024. Later in the evening on Tuesday, Balchunas further noted how well the ten spot BTC ETFs did over the three-day run reaching nearly $10 billion. “Let me put into context how insane $10b in volume is in first 3 days,” Balchunas said. “Today, they did a COMBINDED $450m in volume. The best one did $45m. And many have had months to get going. IBIT alone is seeing more activity than the entire ’23 Freshman Class.” What do you think about the spot bitcoin ETF trade volume over the past three trading days?

However, in a dramatic turn of events later that afternoon, bitcoin’s spot markets experienced a steep decline, with prices falling below the $46,000 mark following a short-lived ascent to $49,000. Earlier in the day, at approximately 9 a.m. (ET), bitcoin (BTC) reached a peak value of $49,048 on Bitstamp. This surge to the $49K level was short-lived, as BTC’s value plummeted, dropping beneath the $46K barrier to a low of $45,700 per unit. Shortly after 11 a.m. (ET), Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst, Eric Balchunas, revealed that the new spot bitcoin ETFs, along with Grayscale’s GBTC, had collectively reached a trading volume of $2.3 billion. “The 10 fresh spot bitcoin ETFs have seen $1.3b in trading volume so far (as a group they already topped BITO’s record). If we add in GBTC we get to $2.3 [billion],” Balchunas said. “And if we add in BITO (which is having record day too but isn’t part of ‘spot’ race) we get $3.5b for the complex,” he added. Since then, BTC’s spot market price has been an absolute rollercoaster ride.    The commencement of trading likely triggered an initial surge in demand, followed by a wave of short-term profit-taking, a typical pattern observed after such significant market events. Bitcoin’s 24-hour trading volume stands at an impressive $57.45 billion, contributing to the total $192.48 billion traded across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. This rapid surge and subsequent drop resulted in significant liquidations of BTC long positions, with $53.58 million being wiped out in just four hours. In the past 24 hours, over $119 million in BTC longs were also liquidated, as reported by coinglass.com’s liquidation metrics. The introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs has injected short-term volatility into the market. This volatility leads to larger price swings, signaling increased uncertainty and risk in the crypto market. Such fluctuations are not unusual following major announcements on Wall Street, as markets adapt to new information and investors recalibrate their portfolios. Currently, the total open interest in bitcoin options is on an upward trajectory, having reached its peak at the close of December 2023. In a parallel development, the total open interest in bitcoin futures is also experiencing a resurgence. CME Group is leading the pack in terms of bitcoin futures open interest with $6.59 billion in contrast to the open interest on Binance, which stands at $4.53 billion on Thursday afternoon at 1:30 p.m. (ET).

Despite this historic regulatory nod, the price of bitcoin witnessed stale action over the past 24 hours. In striking contrast, ethereum rallied, marking a 9.1% rise on Wednesday, overshadowing bitcoin’s underperformance. The SEC’s decision marks a significant turn in the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. Six years after the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust became the first Bitcoin ETF to be rejected in March 2017, the approval of these 11 ETFs represents a watershed moment. However, the market’s response was unexpectedly muted. While such approvals typically fuel bullish sentiments, bitcoin’s price movement remained tepid, suggesting a more complex market dynamic at play.   Experts have been pondering the reasons behind bitcoin’s underwhelming performance, attributing it to various elements. The role of two erroneous announcements is highlighted: Cointelegraph’s incorrect report regarding Blackrock’s ETF and the SEC’s mistaken social media post on platform X. Additionally, the prolonged wait for the SEC’s nod might have led to a “buy the rumor, sell the news” effect, with the market possibly having anticipated the approval.   In stark contrast, ethereum has seen a remarkable surge, pointing to the dynamic and changing nature of the cryptocurrency market. This variance in the trajectories of bitcoin and ethereum following the ETF approval sparks crucial inquiries about the future trends in the crypto world. ETH rose to a high of $2,527 per unit almost immediately after the SEC approved the spot bitcoin ETFs. Moreover, there’s a growing expectation of an imminent spot-based Ethereum ETF. This shift illustrates changing investor attitudes and the maturing market. The crypto realm’s ongoing transformation highlights the fascinating relationship between regulatory decisions and market responses. In light of the numerous misleading events the crypto community has faced, it seems a significant amount of speculative excitement has dissipated.

This indicates that validators have secured a mere 1.41% of the total earned by bitcoin mining pools. In the non-fungible token (NFT) market, BTC continues to surpass ETH. In the last week, NFT sales on the Bitcoin network reached $117.53 million, compared to $71.25 million in sales on the Ethereum network.

This erroneous message from the official Twitter of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sparked a rapid increase in bitcoin’s price, soaring close to $48,000 per unit. Yet, this surge was short-lived as the price promptly dropped to around $45,000 once the market recognized the false nature of the announcement. This event stirred unease among investors and crypto enthusiasts, with some drawing parallels to a pump-and-dump strategy. Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty demanded clarity from the SEC, pointing to possible market manipulation. Hagerty stated: Just like the SEC would demand accountability from a public company if they made such a colossal market-moving mistake, Congress needs answers on what just happened. This is unacceptable. Before this downturn, there was a noticeable upward movement, signifying strong buying interest during this timeframe. The price encountered a ceiling near $47,897, peaked, and then plunged dramatically. Currently, bitcoin’s value is striving to stabilize above the $46,000 zone as of 6:45 p.m. Eastern Time. The anticipation surrounding the endorsement of a spot bitcoin ETF has injected considerable volatility, as traders respond to each update pertaining to its potential sanction. A similar situation unfolded when Cointelegraph inaccurately reported the approval of Blackrock’s spot bitcoin ETF.   The fluctuation in bitcoin’s price on Jan. 9, 2024, mirrors the intricate dynamics of market responses to regulatory developments (both accurate and spurious), expectations of key happenings like the spot BTC ETF sanction, trends in institutional investment, and the overall market mood. Despite these ups and downs, optimism persists around bitcoin, with its market capitalization eclipsing major entities such as Berkshire Hathaway in late 2023. Some believe that the sanction of a spot bitcoin ETF could significantly sway the market, likely boosting institutional involvement and enhancing liquidity. Ahead of this approval, bitcoin had already seen notable price growth, surging over 160% within a year.

BRC20s have emerged as significant players in the crypto asset arena, with several tokens mirroring ORDI’s trajectory. The introduction of BRC20 tokens, an innovative token standard on the Bitcoin blockchain, marked 2023 as a year of substantial growth in value for these assets. BRC20s leverage the Ordinals protocol to facilitate the creation and exchange of fungible tokens, akin to Ethereum’s ERC20, yet functioning under the unique conditions of Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) secured architecture. BRC20 tokens harness the Ordinals protocol, embedding data into individual satoshis, Bitcoin’s smallest denomination. This encoding turns each satoshi into a distinct, fungible token within the Bitcoin network. ORDI, a leading BRC20 token, achieved an unprecedented high on Tuesday.  Hitting $81.34 at its peak, ORDI currently trades between $68 and $72 per coin post-decline from its all-time high, valuing the market at approximately $1.46 billion. Despite a more than 14% drop in a day, ORDI has seen an explosive 2,333% increase since its $2.86 value four months prior. ORDI’s ascent is paralleled by other BRC20 tokens experiencing similar surges. DSPW, another BRC20 token, has a circulating supply of 1,200,000,000 tokens, each trading at $1.66, resulting in a market cap of $1.99 billion. The SATS token boasts a circulation of 2,100,000,000,000,000, with each unit priced at $0.0008168, culminating in a $1.71 billion valuation. Meanwhile, a DOGE-themed BRC20 token trades at $0.001664 per coin with 1,000,000,000,000 in existence, leading to a $1.66 billion market cap. Tracking data for Ordinals-based BRC20s presents challenges due to the nascent nature of the ecosystem, leading to inconsistencies. Nonetheless, the framework has seen marked improvements, with real-time BRC20 data now featured on major coin aggregation sites and a growing number of grassroots explorers and market aggregators.

Following the data collected from Dec. 1 to Dec. 24, 2023, the recent increase of 15.93% against the U.S. dollar has been recorded as the seventh most significant December surge since 2010. Indeed, Santa granted bitcoin enthusiasts a 15.93% boost this December, yet it’s unlikely to be remembered as an official ‘Bitcoin Santa Claus rally‘ akin to the ones seen in 2017 and 2011. From Dec. 1, 2023, to the eve of Christmas, BTC soared from $37,721 per unit to an impressive peak of $43,730. Nonetheless, it secured the seventh spot in the record books, marginally outpacing the 5.6% increase seen from Dec. 1 to Dec. 24 in 2012.  The year 2017 marked BTC’s most significant December rally, escalating from $9,947 to $14,815 between Dec. 1 and Dec. 24, reflecting a 48.94% surge. In a similar period in 2011, BTC experienced a 34.02% rise, climbing from $2.91 to $3.90 per coin. Meanwhile, 2016 recorded what seems to be the last ‘Santa Claus rally’, with a noteworthy 21.46% uptick against the dollar, elevating the price from $743 on Dec. 1 to $902 by Christmas Eve. In 2010, bitcoin experienced a 19.05% rise within the same December period, while 2020 saw an 18.86% increase. The year 2015 witnessed BTC climbing by 17.29%. Aside from 2023’s and 2012’s gains, the years 2022, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2014, and 2013 all endured bearish Decembers. Specifically, in 2022, BTC’s value fell by 2.16% from Dec. 1 to Christmas Eve, and in 2018, it declined by 2.39% during the same December timeframe. Subsequently, in the following December, bitcoin’s price saw a 2.77% decrease between those dates. In 2021, the price experienced a double-digit downturn, plummeting by 10.70%, and in 2014, BTC’s worth diminished by 11.72%. The period from Dec. 1 to Dec. 24, 2013, was notably the most drastic, with BTC prices plunging 41.18%. On Dec. 1, 2013, BTC traded at $1,103 per coin, but by the 24th, it had fallen sharply to $649 per unit. As the crypto community reflects on the fluctuations and festive rallies of bitcoin’s December history, it’s clear that the journey has been as volatile as it has been exhilarating.

As for the market value, a Bitcoin Frog NFT had a floor price of 0.395 BTC, equivalent to $17,241, based on the current BTC exchange rates. Magic Eden saw Bitcoin Frogs reach 193.26 BTC in sales volume, amounting to $8.43 million, within a week. Across various platforms listing Bitcoin Frogs, the collection amassed a total of 328.95 BTC, or $14.35 million in sales. This week’s other notable collections include bitmap, early sub-100K Ordinals indicating they were minted before the 100,000th mark, MNCHRMS, Bitcoin Punks, Ordinal Maxi, Fuzzy Fox, and early sub-10K Ordinals. Bitcoin Ordinal inscription collections, although not quite matching the value of leading Ethereum NFT collections such as Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), are rapidly approaching their stature. The market valuation of Cryptopunks stands at $1.14 billion, significantly overshadowing the $172 million market cap of Bitcoin Frogs. Yet, the market cap of Bitcoin Frogs is more comparable to that of BAYC, valued at $572 million, and MAYC, with a market cap of $224 million.

Yet, despite a significant number of these digital currencies experiencing substantial increases, surpassing even bitcoin in percentage gains, they have yet to approach the peak values achieved during that period. On December 5, 2023, bitcoin’s value surged to $44,490 per coin, marking its highest level in 20 months. Additionally, the overall cryptocurrency market is now valued at $1.67 trillion, with a global trade volume of about $158 billion recorded over the previous day. Reflecting back to April 6, 2022, archived data indicates that bitcoin was trading at $43,926 per coin, following a drop of over 7% against the U.S. dollar within a week. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency market at that time boasted a significantly higher valuation, standing at $2.11 trillion. This figure surpasses the current market value by approximately $440 billion, highlighting a notable reduction in the overall crypto market economy. Twenty months ago, ethereum (ETH) was trading at $3,229 per unit. Today, with a current value of $2,296 per unit, ETH is trading $933 lower than its previous mark. Back then, BNB was valued at $427 per unit, whereas its current trading price stands at $231. Solana (SOL) has experienced significant activity, priced at $118 at that time, and now trading at $62. Another noteworthy point from that period is that Terra’s LUNA was trading at $107 per coin, whereas its current value has plummeted to $0.00022749 per coin. At that time, it ranked as the seventh largest crypto asset, but today, it has fallen to the 55th position. At that time, tether (USDT) had an $82.51 billion market capitalization and it’s higher today at $90 billion. Circle’s usd coin (USDC) had an overall market valuation of around $50.9 billion but it’s now lower at $24.33 billion. Just like LUNA, the once-stable coin terra usd (UST) was a top contender back then with a $16.74 billion market cap that’s now down to $478 million. BUSD also has seen its supply erased over the last 20 months, dropping from $17.7 billion to the current $1.59 billion. Bitcoin’s recent surge to a 20-month high underscores its dominant position in the crypto market. Yet, despite this uptick, many other cryptocurrencies remain far from their past peak values, indicating a diverse and evolving digital currency landscape.

Notably, bitcoin achieved a peak of $39,705 within the day, marking its highest value since late April 2022. The overall cryptocurrency market experienced a surge this Saturday, with an approximate 2% increase over the past day. Bitcoin (BTC) saw a 1.59% rise against the U.S. dollar, while ethereum (ETH) climbed 3.58% in the same 24-hour span.

Although it has been an extended and harsh crypto winter marked by numerous upheavals, a substantial number of crypto assets have seen considerable growth in 2023, mitigating the losses they endured from their peak values. The following analysis focuses on a selection of leading crypto assets, aiming to evaluate their current standings in relation to their historic price highs. Since the beginning of the year, bitcoin (BTC) has seen a 120% surge in value against the U.S. dollar, while ethereum (ETH) has experienced a 63% increase during the same timeframe. Despite these gains, many of the top cryptocurrencies still need to make significant strides to reach and exceed their high points set in November 2021. This review offers insight into the extent to which these digital assets need to rise to return to these levels. On November 10, 2021, bitcoin (BTC) attained a peak value of $69,044 per unit, whereas today, its value hovers around $36,400 per coin. BTC needs an upward push of just over 47% to surpass its former pinnacle, which previously brought its total market value to $1.25 trillion. Ethereum (ETH), ranking second in market capitalization, is currently priced at $1,950 per coin. On the same date in 2021, ETH reached a high of $4,878 per unit. To reclaim its previous high, ETH must ascend by at least 60%, aiming to regain the stature it once maintained. Currently, tether (USDT) ranks as the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, but back in the day, it was Binance’s BNB, priced at $646 per coin, that held this position. BNB reached its zenith months earlier than the November 2021 surge, hitting an all-time high of $686 per unit on May 10, 2021. Presently, BNB’s value is 64% below its highest recorded level. Similarly, XRP did not achieve a new peak that month either, but in November 2021, it was trading at $1.24 per coin. This translates to a 50.88% decrease in XRP’s value since November 2021, as it is now trading at $0.609 per coin as of November 19, 2023. Additionally, XRP has experienced an 82% drop from its ultimate high of $3.40 per coin, recorded on January 7, 2018. Solana (SOL) had a market value of $241 per coin two years ago on November 10, 2021, and reached its all-time high shortly before, on November 6, at $259 per coin. SOL currently stands 76% below its peak at $60 per coin and needs to regain this percentage to surpass its lifetime high. Progressing further, polkadot (DOT) was among the top ten cryptocurrencies back then, and on November 10, 2021, it was being traded at $54.98 per unit. As of now, DOT’s trading price has plummeted to $5.23 per coin, marking a 90% decline from its peak. Cardano (ADA) reached its highest price point a month earlier on September 2, 2021, peaking at $3.09 per coin. Currently, ADA’s value is over 87% below its all-time high at $0.37. Among the aforementioned seven cryptocurrencies discussed, bitcoin (BTC) stands as the one nearest to reclaiming its peak value. ETH and BNB are also relatively closer to their respective price highs compared to the others. What do you think about the gains these cryptos need to achieve to get back to their 2021 price highs?

The financial sector is closely monitoring the progress of several spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) awaiting regulatory approval. These days, investors are increasingly convinced of the crypto asset’s allure to institutional investors. Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital underscored this sentiment in the company’s Q3 earnings call, predicting that “2024 literally is going to be a year of institutional adoption.” On November 9, 2023, BTC reached an 18-month high, with the price of bitcoin soaring to $37,978. The subsequent day, bitcoin’s value has settled slightly above the $37K mark. This fluctuation aligns with heightened institutional attention, evidenced by the CME Group’s bitcoin futures open interest exceeding that of Binance on Friday. Comparatively, 11 months prior, CME ranked third for bitcoin futures open interest, with Binance leading the market.  The current landscape has shifted, with CME at $4.06 billion in open interest, surpassing Binance’s $3.87 billion, according to coinglass.com metrics. The open interest (OI) at CME totals 108,900 BTC, and Binance’s OI is close behind at 103,690 BTC. On November 10, Bybit followed Binance with an OI of $2.75 billion, trailed by Okx at $1.83 billion, with Bitget at $1.20 billion, completing the top five ranks in OI. Overall, the combined crypto futures OI across all trading platforms hit $34.25 billion on Friday, marking a 3.87% increase from the previous day. In light of CME Group surpassing Binance in OI, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart commented on the development on the social media platform X (formally Twitter). “Okay this is interesting,” Seyffart posted. “Does this constitute ‘market of significant size’ now? Haha.” CME Group introduced bitcoin futures on December 18, 2017, during the notable bull run when BTC approached the $20,000 mark for the first time. Prior to CME’s offering, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) was the first institutional platform to launch BTC futures. Nevertheless, Cboe ceased issuing new contracts for its cash-settled XBT bitcoin futures in 2019.

As of November 9, 2023, at 5:20 a.m. Eastern Time, the price of bitcoin peaked above $37K — a peak not observed since the first week of May 2022, stretching over a span of more than 550 days. The valuation of bitcoin (BTC) has escalated by 4.4% against the U.S. dollar this Thursday, marking a strong 34% appreciation over the previous month. Bitcoin is now trading just above the $37K threshold, a level last witnessed on May 6, 2022. This indicates that for an extensive period of over a year, or just beyond 550 days, bitcoin’s price lingered below the $37K mark. It has been 238 days since BTC’s value dipped below $25,000, which occurred on March 16, 2023, and 299 days since it fell under the $20,000 mark on January 14, 2023.   Further, bitcoin has not been priced at $10,000 or lower since July 27, 2020, which dates back approximately 1,200 days. From 2020 to 2023, bitcoin’s price remained below $10,000 for a duration of 202 days, below $20,000 for 471 days, and under $25,000 for 637 days in total.  This week, bitcoin’s price has maintained a solid position above $35K, signaling a bullish outlook as suggested by the latest technical oscillators and moving averages. The 10-day short-term exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA) are flashing bullish signals, indicative of a strong price trajectory in recent times. Despite these positive indications, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index (CFGI) continues to suggest a tilt towards “greed.” The index mirrored this sentiment last week and the day prior as well, while it reflected “neutral” feelings last month as reported by alternative.me. According to the CFGI, “extreme fear” may hint at widespread concern among traders and investors, potentially marking a prime entry juncture. Conversely, “extreme greed” suggests that the crypto market might be ripe for a price correction. Nonetheless, recent statistics highlight that those who wagered on a crypto downturn by positioning short bets have incurred losses amounting to $162 million in the past day alone, with bitcoin’s swift ascent towards $37K causing the liquidation of over 59% of these shorts, equating to about $96 million.

Crypto markets are calm and consolidated at the moment, as market observers and traders wait for the news stemming from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy announcement. Hours before the upcoming FOMC meeting, the crypto economy’s net value is coasting along at $1.3 trillion. Investors are waiting to see whether or not the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise the federal funds rate. However, the CME Fedwatch Tool shows a 97% chance a rate hike will not come to fruition. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields are lower, but the long-term bonds are still at a 16-year high. Equity futures have dropped slightly with the FOMC expectations and anticipation. Currently, at the time of writing, bitcoin (BTC) is exchanging hands at $34,388.22 per unit. The leading crypto asset has recorded a 24-hour range between $34,174 and $34,703 per BTC. Bitcoin commands approximately $8.97 billion in global trade volume on Wednesday, and its market cap dominates by 50.9%.   Bitcoin’s current state reflects a strong bullish momentum, underscored by its significant price surge over the last fortnight. The relative strength index (RSI) at 79 and Stochastic at 75 both point toward overbought conditions, signaling the potential for a price correction or consolidation in the near term. However, the moving averages tell a different story; with the exponential moving average (EMA) at $33,586 and simple moving average (SMA) at $34,173, both indicators suggest a bullish signal, reinforcing the prevailing upward trend. Despite the positive price movement, the discrepancy between the oscillators and moving averages necessitates caution. The overbought conditions indicated by the RSI and Stochastic could lead to increased volatility, and traders should be prepared for potential short-term price fluctuations. The moving averages, while bullish, could also be interpreted in conjunction with the caution signals shown by the two oscillators. Presently, ethereum’s (ETH) price is coasting along at $1,796 per unit. ETH has witnessed a 24-hour range of $1,786 to $1,827 per ether. Ethereum’s volume is higher than BTC’s today with $10.56 billion traded over the last 24 hours. In terms of market dominance, ETH’s market valuation amounts to 16.4% of the $1.3 trillion crypto economy.   Ethereum presents a more tempered growth story, with a 3.9% increase in price over the past month. The oscillators, with an RSI of 67 and Stochastic of 76, do not indicate an extreme market condition, suggesting a more stable and neutral environment compared to bitcoin. The moving averages, with an EMA of $1,771 and SMA of $1,792, provide additional support for a positive outlook, though the growth is not as pronounced as that of bitcoin. The steadier price movement of ethereum, coupled with the less extreme oscillator values, positions ETH as a potentially less volatile option in the current market. However, traders should still exercise caution and consider a range of indicators and market conditions before making trading decisions. The positive trend indicated by the moving averages is a promising sign, but it is crucial to remain vigilant and stay updated with market developments.

Yet, intriguingly, the famed “Kimchi premium” in South Korea remains absent in this current surge of bullish activity. This is a notable deviation from previous bull markets, where the phenomenon was prominently observed. In fact, this time around, BTC prices in South Korea are trading at a discount compared to other parts of the world. This month, bitcoin has exhibited remarkable performance, appreciating 27.9% against the U.S. dollar. As of 10:15 a.m. EDT, BTC hovered just above the $34K mark, boasting a seven-day gain of 14.8%. Intriguingly, during this upward trajectory, bitcoin prices on South Korea’s top crypto exchanges, Upbit and Bithumb, are slightly lower. This scenario stands in stark contrast to the “Kimchi premium” observed in previous years, which typically manifested during crypto bull runs, pushing BTC’s value several hundred dollars above the global average. Currently, bitcoin trading is thriving in South Korea, with cryptocompare.com data revealing that the Korean won is bitcoin’s fifth largest trading pair, accounting for 3.73% of all BTC’s global trades. Despite BTC’s global trading price of $34,059 at the time of writing, it is exchanging hands at $33,902 on Upbit and approximately $33,869 on Bithumb. This translates to a $157 and roughly $190 per unit discount on Upbit and Bithumb, respectively. Contrary to the “Kimchi premium,” where not just BTC, but also other cryptocurrencies like XRP and ETH would experience price elevations, the current discounts are uniquely impacting bitcoin’s value. Ethereum, for example, is exhibiting a minor discount discrepancy of around $10-15 per unit. On the trading front, Bithumb recorded approximately $408 million in global trades on Friday, while Upbit saw a much higher $1.7 billion. Among Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit, Upbit dominates in the country, commanding nearly 80% of South Korea’s crypto trading volume. South Korea’s government and regulators from the country have tried to curb the “Kimchi premium” and put the trend to an end. While there is no sign of a premium, a “Kimchi discount” still brings an opportunity for arbitrage. What do you think about the lack of the “Kimchi premium” during bitcoin’s current upswing?

The index measuring the balance between fear and greed emotions of participants in the crypto market entered the green zone of the scale this week.  The price of bitcoin (BTC) surged this week, likely in reaction to developments interpreted positively by investors anticipating the regulatory approval of America’s first spot bitcoin ETF. BTC is trading well over $34,000 at the time of writing, compared to around $28,000 last Thursday. The change in sentiment was quickly registered by the Crypto Fear and Greed Index (CFGI) which exceeded 70 points out of 100 this week and stands at 71 (greed) on Oct. 26, according to the one devised by the software development platform Alternative.me. Last week, the indicator was in the neutral zone and last month it was below 50 (fear). On this scale, zero means “extreme fear,” when many worried investors are irrationally selling, while 100 represents “extreme greed” with many people buying during a rising market. Coinmarketcap’s Fear and Greed Index is currently slightly higher, at 72 points. According to the crypto data aggregation site, the indicator remained neutral for most of October before entering the green zone this week when market sentiments changed significantly. The index had been predominantly expressing investors’ fear between around mid-August and late September and the last time it registered greed before that was in mid-July, the chart provided by Coinmarketcap.com shows. Market moods in 2023 have been influenced to a great extent by negative news related to the ongoing regulatory crackdown on the industry since last year’s collapses of major platforms in the space such as cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The prospects of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot bitcoin ETF in the coming months have played a balancing role. According to a recent research by Galaxy Digital, a spot-based bitcoin ETF would boost the price of BTC by 74% in the first year after launch.

This isn’t an isolated event; platforms such as Binance, Deribit, Bitget, and Okx are also experiencing significant upticks. For those new to the term, in bitcoin futures, open interest (OI) represents market engagement and the volume of money or contracts actively circulating. In layman’s terms, it’s the sum of unsettled futures contracts — those not yet cleared by a counter-trade or delivery. Recent data shows a noteworthy increase in bitcoin futures OI in just 48 hours. K33 Research‘s latest findings highlight CME BTC futures OI’s rise beyond 100,000 BTC, setting a new record. With this leap, CME now commands a 25% market slice, narrowing the gap with Binance’s lead in the futures sector to a mere 4%. On October 23, there was also a notable rise in CME’s options volume and OI related to BTC futures.  Deribit isn’t far behind, with both its futures and options showing significant growth. The platform’s bitcoin options OI soared past the $12 billion benchmark, with its bitcoin futures OI inching close to a billion. At its core, OI provides insights into the overall activity and capital flow in the futures market. When OI climbs, it typically signals heightened market enthusiasm, whereas a decline might hint at waning interest. As of October 23, Binance reported a whopping $12.08 billion in bitcoin futures OI. Other significant players in the futures domain encompass Bitget, Okx, Gate.io, Kucoin, and Bitmex. Meanwhile, Dydx and Crypto.com have also witnessed OI spikes recently. This newfound interest is largely attributed to the potential approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. The recent legal victory by Grayscale and Blackrock’s ETF preparations are interpreted by many as auspicious signs for the future.

This rise catapulted bitcoin’s value to $35,108 per unit, propelling the entire cryptocurrency market upwards by over 10%. As the market soared, traders who had placed their bets against crypto assets like bitcoin and ethereum found themselves in a tight spot. In a mere 24 hours, a staggering $323 million in crypto short positions evaporated. Currently, the cryptocurrency market’s value hovers around a whopping $1.3 trillion, marking a 10% increase. Within the past day, BTC’s value ascended by 13%. Other major players also saw notable gains: ETH leaped by 9%, BNB ascended by 5%, and XRP and Solana both notched a 7% hike. These rapid price escalations have left those who shorted top cryptocurrencies scrambling, as their positions vanished in the wake of these impressive and quick rallies. Recent data from Coinglass reveals that in the last 12 hours, the market witnessed the liquidation of $51.91 million in long positions and a hefty $103 million in short positions. Breaking down the 24-hour stats, short positions worth $323 million were obliterated, and another $104 million in longs faced a similar fate. Notably, of the total shorts liquidated, bitcoin contracts made up a significant chunk, accounting for $232 million out of the $323 million total.

Present figures demonstrate that bitcoin (BTC) constitutes approximately 54% of the total cryptocurrency market value, with ethereum (ETH) trailing at just above 17%. Bitcoin’s hegemony witnessed a significant swell this year, escalating from 40.2% in October 2022 to the current 54% by October 2023. Insights compiled by Tradingview on October 24, 2023, pinpoint fluctuations in bitcoin’s dominance, ranging from 53.44% to 54.11%. Per Tradingview’s methodology, this calculation involves a comparative assessment of bitcoin against the aggregate value of the top 125 cryptocurrencies. The online platform underscores a noteworthy statistic: BTC’s rise to this level is a first in over 980 days — a span extending beyond two years and eight months.  Rewinding to January 2017 and prior, bitcoin’s representation eclipsed 80-90% of the entire crypto market. Ethereum (ETH), holding the title of the second-largest market capitalization, now embodies 17.6% of the crypto economy. Despite ETH’s dominance standing at 21.24% in October 2021, it suffered a decline, reaching a low of 15% by May 2022. Just a year ago in October, ETH’s dominance clocked in at 19.3%, but it has been experiencing a downward trajectory since April 2023. Conversely, BTC’s dominance has been climbing the ladder since April 2023, progressing from 47.89% to its present position. While ether’s share comes closest to bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies in the top ten pale in comparison, given that both collectively constitute 71% of the market. For perspective, the third-largest cryptocurrency, tether (USDT), comprises a mere 6.667% of the expansive $1.26 trillion market. Following are BNB and XRP, representing 2.767% and 2.305% respectively. Cumulatively, the top eight digital currencies, excluding BTC and ETH, encompass 17.55% of the market. Current data illustrates that today’s top ten cryptocurrencies collectively account for an overwhelming 88% of the total market. In the whirlwind world of crypto, fortunes shift in a heartbeat, and it’s entirely plausible that these rankings could undergo a seismic transformation by the time October 2024 rolls around.

Looking at the chart, the decline comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) maintains its position marginally above a floor at the 62.00 level. As of writing, the index is tracking at a reading of 62.28, after a failed breakout from a resistance of 65.00 on Monday. Price may continue to consolidate until either the aforementioned floor or ceiling is broken. Ethereum (ETH) made slight gains on hump-day, as it continued to hover around the $1,580 mark. Following a low of $1,554.40 on Tuesday, ETH/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $1,584.73 during the day. Earlier gains have since eased, with ethereum now trading at $1,577.40, with short-term bulls still targeting the $1,600 zone.   This may be difficult to achieve as momentum appears to be bearish, with the 10-day (red) moving average continuing to trend downwards. Whilst at a reading of 45.75, a ceiling awaits ETH’s price strength at the 49.00 zone, and should it move beyond this, there will likely be an influx of bulls.

Presently, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index (CFGI) hovers at a “neutral” 50 out of 100, a stance it’s held over the past week. Technical data reinforces this balanced outlook, indicating bitcoin’s price movement has nestled into a tighter band. A week prior, bitcoin (BTC) was priced at $27,189 per unit. Over the past day, its value danced between $28,103 and $27,770. This week witnessed a 2.6% climb in bitcoin’s value, and it surged by 7.9% on a 30-day scale. Throughout these fluctuations, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index (CFGI) has unswervingly projected its “neutral” position — not just today, but yesterday and the entire past week. In essence, the CFGI serves as a barometer, gauging the prevailing mood of the bitcoin marketplace. Its goal? To arm traders with insights into the collective psyche of market players.  The rationale being that overwhelming fear can depress prices too much, while rampant greed can inflate them excessively. By tapping into current sentiments, traders could pinpoint potential buy or sell moments. Interpreting the CFGI, one encounters phases like extreme fear, fear, neutral, greed, and extreme greed. On October 8, 2023, alternative.me pegs the CFGI at 50, a slight rise from last week’s 48. Coinmarketcap.com’s “Fear and Greed” index echoes this sentiment, marking a neutral score of 46 on Sunday. With the market exhibiting such neutrality and bitcoin gravitating towards a more streamlined range, it’s evident the market remains indecisive. Being neutral or ambivalent suggests the absence of a prevailing sentiment. It’s akin to a balance where neither pessimistic bears nor optimistic bulls command the market. However, neutrality doesn’t imply market stagnation. Prices may ebb and flow, but the index conveys a harmony between bullish and bearish forces. Technical metrics for bitcoin, such as oscillators like the relative strength index (RSI) and stochastic (14, 3, 3), also exhibit this weekend’s neutral sentiment. When oscillators like the RSI and the stochastic (14, 3, 3) display neutrality, it signals that the asset is neither in an overbought nor oversold state. With the current RSI around 61 and a stochastic reading near 75, there’s a balance between buy and sell pressures. Given these readings from both the oscillators and CFGI, it seems the market is poised in a consolidation phase, awaiting future cues or triggers.

The 24-hour trading volume for bitcoin (BTC) is $23.02 billion, indicating robust market activity. The market capitalization of bitcoin remains strong at $1.36 trillion. Bitcoin’s daily chart highlights a major uptrend starting in early May, peaking at $71,958, followed by a slight pullback and consolidation near the $68,000-$70,000 range. The daily chart shows support is firmly positioned at $66,000, with resistance at the recent high of $71,958. The mix of ups and downs suggests ongoing market contention, while a reduction in volume during consolidation hints at a temporary pause in the upward momentum. The 4-hour chart reveals a correction from $69,524 to $66,624, followed by a steady recovery. Support at $66,624 and resistance at $69,524 define the current trading range. Recent price upswings show increased buying pressure, suggesting a bullish sentiment at the lower end of this range. Volume analysis supports this, with higher volume during the upticks indicating continued buying interest. Analyzing the 1-hour chart, short-term fluctuations are evident with a recent low at $67,281 and a recovery to $69,312. Support is noted at $67,281 and resistance at $69,312. The consolidation below $69,000 with decreasing volume signifies market indecision, which may precede a breakout or further consolidation, contingent on broader market forces. Oscillators provide a mixed outlook. The relative strength index (RSI) at 57 and the Stochastic at 35 suggest neutral conditions. However, the momentum indicator at 377 signals a bullish sentiment, countered by the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) level at 939 indicating a sell. These mixed oscillator signals underscore the need for cautious trading strategies. Moving averages (MAs) paint a predominantly bullish picture. Short-term (10-day) and medium-term (20- to 50-day) moving averages all signal a buy, with prices consistently above these averages. Long-term indicators (100- and 200-day) also reflect a bullish sentiment, further reinforcing the current uptrend despite the consolidation phase. Given the strong buying interest at key support levels, along with positive signals from multiple moving averages, bitcoin appears poised for further gains. The consolidation phase may serve as a foundation for the next upward movement, potentially challenging recent highs. Despite the bullish sentiment from moving averages, mixed signals from oscillators and a notable consolidation phase suggest caution. If bitcoin fails to break above the $70,000 resistance level, a deeper correction toward the $66,000 support could materialize, indicating a potential bearish trend.

Meanwhile, Peter Schiff has insisted that the cryptocurrency “has underperformed gold for the past 2.5 years.” Veteran trader Peter Brandt, a renowned figure in the trading community with over four decades of experience, has emphasized bitcoin’s consistent gains against gold since its inception. He illustrated this with a chart showing the number of gold ounces required to purchase one bitcoin. Brandt predicts that this ratio will remain volatile for the next 12 to 18 months before rising to 100 ounces of gold per BTC. Referencing GC_F, a gold futures contract traded on the COMEX exchange, which is part of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, the veteran trader wrote on social media platform X on Thursday: Since its inception bitcoin BTC has gained against gold. This chart shows the # oz. of GC_F to buy one BTC. The ratio should chop for another 12 to 18 months — then advance to 100 oz of GC to buy a BTC.  Brandt also seeks gold advocate Peter Schiff’s opinion on this projection. “What say you @PeterSchiff,” his X post concludes. This was not the first time Brandt had tried to engage Schiff on the subject of gold versus bitcoin. Schiff has asserted that gold has outperformed bitcoin. The gold bug recently wrote on X: “On Oct. 21, 2021, it took 37 ounces of gold to buy one bitcoin. Today it takes only 29. That’s a 22% decline, an official bear market.” He insisted that BTC “has underperformed gold for the past 2.5 years.” Brandt disagreed. In April, he urged Schiff to “put things in a broader perspective” when comparing gold to bitcoin. A vocal bitcoin proponent, Brandt holds the view that BTC is vying to replace fiat currency as the primary store of value. However, he recently issued a serious warning about the future of crypto staking, calling it “the biggest disaster yet to come in crypto.” He anticipates significant disasters, bankruptcies, and personal financial losses within the sector.

Throughout the previous day, BTC’s price has maintained a tightly consolidated triangular pattern. Bitcoin’s (BTC) daily chart reveals a market that has transitioned from a significant rally to a consolidation phase. After an impressive rise from $56,500 on May 1, to $71,958 on May 20, bitcoin’s price has fluctuated within a narrower range, indicating a period of market indecision. Key resistance stands at $71,958, while support has shifted from $56,500 to around $66,000. Trading volume has diminished during this consolidation, suggesting reduced market activity. On the 4-hour chart, BTC exhibits a short-term bullish trend, characterized by higher highs and higher lows, peaking at $70,601. This is followed by a corrective phase with lower highs and lows, reflecting increased selling pressure. The primary resistance is at $70,601, and support is identified at around $67,096. Significant volume spikes at these levels suggest substantial trading activity, which traders should monitor closely. The hourly chart offers a micro perspective within the larger daily and 4-hour trends. A recent dip to $67,105 was followed by a minor rally to $69,524 and a subsequent pullback, indicating short-term fluctuations. Key resistance is at $69,524, with support around $67,105. Candlestick patterns show signs of consolidation, with small bullish and bearish engulfing patterns suggesting short-term movements. Oscillators present a mixed picture. The relative strength index (RSI) is at 55, indicating a neutral stance, while the Stochastic oscillator is at 42, the commodity channel index (CCI) at 38, and the average directional index (ADX) at 22 also suggests a lack of strong momentum in either direction. The awesome oscillator is at 3506, and the momentum is at -1830, indicating a positive signal, whereas the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) level at 1167 suggests a bearish signal. Regarding moving averages (MAs), the picture is more bullish. The exponential moving averages (EMAs) for 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, and 200 periods are all giving bullish signals. In contrast, the simple moving averages (SMAs) provide a mixed outlook: the 10 SMA at $68,529 indicates bearish momentum, while the 20 SMA at $67,226, 30 SMA at $65,527, 50 SMA at $64,872, 100 SMA at$ 65,400, and 200 SMA at $54,135 all suggest bullish sentiment. This alignment generally supports the market positivity, albeit with caution advised around the shorter-term SMAs. Given the prevailing bullish signals from the majority of the MAs and the potential for a breakout above the key resistance levels identified in the daily and 4-hour charts, the overall outlook for bitcoin remains positive. Traders might consider buying at support levels and watching for confirmation of a continued uptrend. Despite the bullish signals from most of BTC’s MAs, the mixed signals from the oscillators, including the MACD sell signal and the neutral stance of the RSI, suggest caution. The market consolidation and decreased volume could indicate the potential for further sideways movement or a pullback, advising traders to remain vigilant for signs of a downtrend.

At the time of writing, the token’s market value stood at $695 million. A new meme coin has entered the top ten meme token rankings, and for the first time, it marks a significant achievement for a meme coin asset created from the Bitcoin blockchain. The token, DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON, referred to as DOG hereafter, has steadily climbed the ranks since its launch and airdrop to Runestone NFT holders. According to data collected by coingecko.com, DOG is the ninth largest meme coin by market cap, but it ranks as the 132nd crypto asset by market valuation among all cryptocurrencies globally. At press time, DOG is trading at $0.006997 per unit as of 6 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday. The current price reflects a 7.5% decline from its all-time high (ATH) of $0.007542 per coin on May 30, 2024. The Runes-based meme token’s market valuation peaked at $745 million. Over the past week, DOG has increased by 79% against the U.S. dollar, and it has surged 216% over the last 30 days. Current data indicates that 70,292 unique bitcoin addresses hold DOG, with the top address controlling 3.24% of the supply. On the digital collectibles marketplace operated by Okx, DOG is the most popular Runes-based token today, recording 577.39 BTC, or $39 million, in the past 24 hours. On Magic Eden, DOG ranks as the second most traded Runes token, with a 24-hour trade volume of 86.57 BTC, or $5.8 million. DOG’s ascent exemplifies the growing influence of meme tokens within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As mainstream adoption of digital assets accelerates, unconventional tokens like DOG and many others could potentially disrupt traditional financial markets, challenging longstanding assumptions about value and investment paradigms.

The current price stands at $67,739 with an intraday range of $67,201 to $68,880. Technical indicators and moving averages provide a mixed outlook, indicating both potential stability and the possibility of future movements. Bitcoin’s 1-hour chart reveals a high of $69,513 and a low of $67,193. The sharp decline followed by sideways movement signifies a lack of strong momentum in either direction. Volume spikes are seen during the sharp movements, yet recent lower volumes suggest trader indecision. Key levels to monitor are the support at $67,200 and resistance at $69,500, as breaking these could determine short-term direction. On the 4-hour chart, BTC reached a high of $70,601 and a low of $66,343. The price action indicates a significant bullish move followed by a consolidation phase with lower highs and higher lows, potentially forming a symmetrical triangle. The volume spikes during sharp price changes, followed by lower volumes during consolidation, emphasize the cautious sentiment prevailing in the market. The daily chart provides a broader perspective, showing an overall uptrend from a low of $56,500 to a high of $71,958. Recently, the price has been consolidating in the $68,000 to $70,000 range. The volume analysis on the daily chart supports this consolidation phase, with lower trading activity indicating a temporary pause in the bullish momentum. Analyzing the oscillators, the relative strength index (RSI) stands at 54, indicating a neutral stance. Other oscillators like the Stochastic, commodity channel index (CCI), and average directional index (ADX) also show neutral values. However, the momentum and MACD level suggest a buy signal, highlighting potential bullish sentiments in the near term. The moving averages (MAs) present a mixed outlook. Short-term averages such as the ten-day exponential moving average (EMA) and ten-day simple moving average (SMA) indicate a sell signal, while the medium to long-term averages like the EMA (20, 30, 50, 100, 200) and SMA (20, 30, 50, 100, 200) signal bullish sentiment. This divergence underscores the current market’s indecision, with short-term caution contrasting with longer-term optimism. If bitcoin can sustain above the key support level of $67,200 and break through the $69,500 resistance with increasing volume, it may signal a continuation of the bullish trend, potentially targeting new highs. Should bitcoin fail to maintain the $67,200 support and face continued selling pressure, it might indicate a bearish reversal, leading to further declines and testing lower support levels.

The leading crypto asset has experienced an intraday price range of $68,308 to $69,340 with a 24-hour trade volume of $10.74 billion.  The short-term analysis based on BTC’s 1-hour chart reveals a slight downward trend following a failed attempt to maintain the $69,500 level. The support level is established at $68,136, with resistance at $69,500. Recent price action shows consolidation around the $68,500 to $69,000 range, indicating a potential stabilizing phase. Notably, volume spikes during price drops highlight strong selling pressure, while lower volumes on the upswings suggest weak buying interest. In the medium-term, the 4-hour chart exhibits a slightly bearish trend characterized by lower highs and lows. The support level is marked at $66,343, with resistance at $70,649. The price has struggled to break above $69,000, reinforcing this as a key resistance area. Increased volume during large price drops further underscores the dominance of selling activity in this timeframe. The long-term outlook from the daily chart shows bitcoin’s recovery from a low of $56,500, but it is currently facing resistance around $71,000. This significant resistance level at $71,958 is pivotal for bitcoin’s next upward movement. The uptrend’s momentum appears to be waning as the price consolidates below this resistance. High volume during the recent uptrend towards $71,958 indicates strong buying interest, yet recent volume spikes on the latest price dips point to growing selling pressure. Oscillator readings provide mixed signals. The relative strength index (RSI) at 57 and the Stochastic at 71 both reflect a neutral stance, suggesting no immediate overbought or oversold conditions. Similarly, the commodity channel index (CCI) and the awesome oscillator also present neutral readings. However, the momentum indicator signals bearish sentiment with a value of 1411, while the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) level suggests positivity at 1438, indicating potential volatility and indecision in the market. Moving averages (MAs) show a predominantly bullish signal. Short-term moving averages, including the 10-period exponential moving average (EMA) and the 20-period simple moving average (SMA), show bullish sentiment, reinforcing the potential for upward movement. Similarly, medium to long-term MAs, such as the 50-period and 200-period EMAs and SMAs, all indicate bullish actions, suggesting a positive outlook in the broader timeframes. Based on the predominance of bullish signals from the moving averages and the strong recovery seen in the long-term trend, bitcoin could see a continuation of its upward trajectory. The consolidation below key resistance levels may serve as a platform for a potential breakout, especially if buying interest strengthens as indicated by volume spikes during uptrends. The bearish trend observed in the short-term and medium-term charts, coupled with mixed signals from oscillators, suggests caution. The price struggling to break above significant resistance levels and the recent increase in selling pressure could lead to further downward movement if bearish momentum continues. Traders should closely monitor these levels and be prepared for potential declines.

Meanwhile, Kiyosaki expects bitcoin’s price to reach $2.3 million. The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has returned with more investment advice for investors. He is cautioning that the bond market is crashing and investors should seek real assets, like bitcoin. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries. Kiyosaki posted on social media platform X on Sunday: “Biggest lie financial planners tell gullible, mom and pop investors: The lie is: ‘Bonds are safe.’ Millions of even so-called ‘sophisticated’ investors will take losses when so-called AAA bonds crash when commercial real estate crashes. The once glamorous office real estate market cannot make loan payments which will take down so-called ‘sophisticated’ investors when AAA bonds crash.” He advised: Best get into safer real assets such as gold, silver, and bitcoin before their prices explode. The renowned author has consistently warned of impending stock and bond market crashes, advising investors to buy gold, silver, and bitcoin. In April, he predicted bitcoin could reach $2.3 million and expects BTC to hit $100,000 by September. He frequently urges investors to abandon the U.S. dollar for bitcoin, considering fiat currencies as fake money.

The cryptocurrency’s price has fluctuated within the range of $66,665 to $70,028 over the last 24 hours.  Recent trends in the daily chart reveal bitcoin (BTC) reaching a peak of $71,958 before retreating to its current price range. The volume has shown significant drawdowns, indicating selling pressure. Candlestick patterns, such as bearish engulfing, suggest potential reversal points, particularly around the recent peak. The 4-hour chart mirrors the daily trend, showing the same short-term high at $71,958 followed by a sharp decline. Currently, bitcoin is consolidating around $67,000 with lower highs and lower lows, indicating some bearish sentiment. High volume during the decline from $71,958 to $67,000 reinforces this bearish outlook. A descending trendline forms from the peak, suggesting ongoing selling pressure. A potential bullish reversal might occur if the price breaks above recent lower highs. The hourly chart shows immediate resistance around $70,024, where the recent decline began. Bitcoin’s price has stabilized around $67,000 after testing lows near $66,343. The volume analysis shows a spike in sell volume around $70,024, followed by a gradual decrease. The current bearish continuation pattern suggests an ongoing downtrend with intermittent consolidation, with support and resistance levels at $66,343 and $70,024, respectively. Various oscillators provide a mixed signal for bitcoin. The relative strength index (RSI) is at 55, indicating a neutral stance. The Stochastic, commodity channel index (CCI), and average directional index (ADX) all point to a neutral action. However, the momentum and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) level oscillators indicates optimistic sentiment, suggesting some underlying bullish momentum despite the prevailing bearish sentiment. Moving averages (MAs) offer a predominantly bullish outlook. The exponential moving averages (EMA) for 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, and 200 periods all suggest bullish sentiment, indicating upward momentum over various timeframes. However, the 10-period simple moving average (SMA) signals bearish action, while other SMAs (20, 30, 50, 100, 200) align with the EMAs, indicating a broader bullish trend. Given the overall bullish signals from the moving averages and the optimistic signal from the momentum and MACD level oscillators, bitcoin could see a potential upward move if it breaks above key resistance levels. Traders should look for strong volume confirming the breakout to take long positions. Despite some bullish indicators, the presence of significant selling pressure and bearish candlestick patterns cannot be ignored. If bitcoin fails to break above resistance levels and continues to show lower highs and lower lows, the bearish trend may persist, warranting caution for potential downside risk.

Despite a tumultuous period, bitcoin has shown resilience with an 11.9% increase over the past week and a 5.9% rise over the past month.  Bitcoin’s 1-hour chart reveals a significant decline from a peak of $71,433 to a low of $69,156. Recently, there’s been a hint of a potential reversal suggesting slight upward movement. Volume spikes have been notable during the downtrend, with a modest increase accompanying the recent upward ticks. Traders might consider an entry point if bitcoin breaks above the $70,000 resistance level with strong volume support, targeting an exit around the $71,433 mark if the uptrend solidifies. On the 4-hour chart, bitcoin’s broader trend showcases a decline from $71,958 with a current phase of consolidation between $69,000 and $70,500. The volume spikes seen during the initial drop have given way to moderate levels during this consolidation phase. An entry strategy could involve watching for bitcoin to sustain levels above $70,000 and break through the $70,500 resistance, with potential exits near the $71,958 mark if decreasing volume is observed. The daily chart provides a longer-term perspective, highlighting a surge from $56,500 on May 1, to a high of $71,958, followed by consolidation around the $70,000 level. The volume during this surge was strong, tapering off during the consolidation. Traders might look for an entry point if bitcoin closes above $71,000 with rising volume, suggesting a possible continuation of the uptrend. Analyzing the oscillators, bitcoin shows mixed signals: the relative strength index (RSI) at 70.2 suggests bearish action, while the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) level at 106.1 indicates bullish sentiment. The Stochastic and commodity channel index (CCI) are showing neutral and sell signals, respectively. The awesome oscillator and momentum indicators also present neutral and sell actions, underscoring the mixed sentiment in the market. Moving averages (MAs) are predominantly bullish across various timeframes, with exponential moving averages (EMAs) and simple moving averages (SMAs) over 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, and 200 periods all indicating bullish action. This consistent bullish trend across moving averages suggests that despite short-term fluctuations and mixed oscillator signals, the longer-term outlook for bitcoin remains positive. Given the strong buy signals from moving averages and the potential for a continuation of the uptrend, if bitcoin breaks key resistance levels with increased volume, the longer-term outlook for bitcoin remains bullish. Traders should look for opportunities to enter on breakouts and ride the uptrend toward new highs. Despite the bullish signals from moving averages, caution is warranted due to the mixed signals from oscillators and recent consolidation patterns. If bitcoin fails to break above key resistance levels and bearish patterns emerge, a downside movement could ensue, making it prudent to consider exits or hedging strategies to protect against potential declines.

He explained that if 1% of the world’s $738 trillion in financial assets were allocated to bitcoin, it would result in $7.4 trillion in inflows, raising bitcoin’s price to $420,000.  Ric Edelman, a financial advisor and founder of Edelman Financial Engines, predicts bitcoin will reach $420,000 by the end of the decade. In an opinion piece published by Think Advisor, Edelman discussed how significant planned allocations from financial advisors could drive the price of BTC. He described: My analysis reveals that bitcoin will reach $420,000 by the end of the decade. I reach this figure based on simple arithmetic. Edelman referenced surveys, including those by Franklin Templeton, revealing that over 75% of independent registered investment advisors (RIAs) plan to allocate 2.5% of their assets to bitcoin. With RIAs managing $8 trillion, this equates to $150 billion flowing into the cryptocurrency. He also speculated that additional allocations could come from family offices, pension funds, endowments, and other institutional investors. The financial advisor noted that global financial assets total $738 trillion, a figure he calculated by adding the values of the global equity market, debt market, real estate market, gold market, cash market, bitcoin, and other assets as of Dec.31. This unique supply constraint underpins his analysis of bitcoin’s potential price rise. Emphasizing bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins, he stressed: “If all the advisors, investors, and institutions that manage these assets were to allocate just 1% of their client portfolios to bitcoin, the total flows would be $7.4 trillion. Of the 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist, 19.4 million exist today — meaning the flows would increase each bitcoin by about $378,000.” Edelman continued, “Add in bitcoin’s current price,” which was about $42K as of Dec. 31, he concluded: “You get bitcoin’s future price: roughly $420,000.” Do you agree with Ric Edelman’s prediction that bitcoin will reach $420,000 by the end of the decade?

The cryptocurrency has experienced a 24-hour range between $66,000 and $67,431, with a market capitalization of $1.32 trillion and a trading volume of $21.18 billion.  The daily chart indicates that bitcoin (BTC) is in a prolonged uptrend, having recently reached a high of $67,654. Key support is observed at around $56,500, a level tested during the most recent dip. Despite the strong bullish momentum signaled by multiple large upswings, there is noticeable selling pressure near the recent highs, as evidenced by the dips that followed. Volume fluctuations align with significant price movements, suggesting active market participation. On the 4-hour chart, bitcoin’s price action reveals a strong uptrend from $61,322 to $67,654, followed by a period of consolidation. Support is solidified around $65,500, while resistance remains at $67,654, consistent with the daily chart. The mix of ups and downs during consolidation indicates market indecision, though recent upticks suggest the potential for bullish continuation. Increased volume during significant price movements further corroborates this trend. The hourly chart presents a short-term uptrend within the broader trend, with a recent pullback to $65,901 before recovery. Support at $65,901 aligns with the level where the dip was bought up, reinforcing its significance. Resistance remains at $67,654, a critical level across all timeframes. The presence of several drops followed by some upswings indicates a potential reversal. Analyzing the oscillators, the relative strength index (RSI) at 58 points to a neutral market stance. The Stochastic is at 89, also reflecting neutrality. However, the commodity channel index (CCI) at 122 suggests a sell signal, indicating potential overbought conditions. The average directional index (ADX) at 21 denotes a weak trend, while the awesome oscillator, with a value of 3103, remains neutral. Notably, the momentum oscillator at 6389 and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) level at 682 both suggest a buy signal, indicating upward momentum. The moving averages (MAs) paint a predominantly bullish picture. Both the exponential moving averages and simple moving averages across 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, and 200 periods indicate buy signals. The EMA at $65,222 and the SMA at $64,568 support the current price level, reinforcing the bullish outlook. The longer-term averages, such as the EMA (200) at $53,971 and the SMA (200) at $52,316, further underpin this positive trend, suggesting strong support levels well below the current price. Given the strong upward trends observed in both short-term and long-term charts, supported by multiple buy signals from moving averages and momentum oscillators, the overall outlook for bitcoin remains bullish. Traders should watch for a breakout above the $67,654 resistance level, which could signal further price increases. Despite the prevailing bullish sentiment, some caution is warranted due to neutral signals from several oscillators and the potential for selling pressure near current highs. Should bitcoin fail to break above the $67,654 resistance, a pullback to the support level around $65,500 or lower is possible, indicating potential bearish pressure.

Technical indicators from multiple time frames suggest a potential continuation of the bullish trend, albeit amidst notable market volatility. The convergence of moving averages and oscillators signals a strong upward momentum. Bitcoin’s hourly chart shows a recent recovery from $64,598 to $66,766, with significant volume spikes during price movements, indicating strong market participation. Key support is found between $65,500 and $65,700, with resistance around $66,700 to $67,000. This consolidation pattern highlights a potential for further gains if the resistance is breached.  The four-hour chart provides a broader perspective, revealing a decline to approximately $60,600 followed by a robust recovery to $66,766. The volume spikes align with major price movements, suggesting strong market activity. Here, the support level around $64,500 to $65,000 is crucial, while resistance near $67,000 remains a key target for bulls.  On the daily chart, bitcoin’s price experienced a sharp decline to $56,500 on April 30, before a strong recovery to a recent high of $67,241. This volatility underscores the market’s susceptibility to significant fluctuations. The support zone between $62,000 and $63,000 is vital, while the resistance range of $66,500 to $67,000 could dictate future price action. Oscillators present a mixed yet cautiously optimistic outlook. The relative strength index (RSI) at 57 and the Stochastic at 90 both remain neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. However, the commodity channel index (CCI) at 158 suggests a bearish signal, while the awesome oscillator and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) levels both indicate a buy, reflecting underlying bullish momentum. Moving averages (MAs) across various time frames predominantly signal a buy. The exponential (EMA) and simple moving averages (SMA) from 10 to 200 periods all indicate bullish trends. For instance, the 10-period EMA at $63,770 and the 200-period SMA at $51,835 underscore the current price’s strength above these averages, supporting the bullish outlook. Bitcoin’s current technical indicators and market conditions point to a bullish trend continuation, with strong support and upward momentum suggesting potential for further price increases. Despite bullish signals, market volatility and mixed oscillator readings could indicate a possible retracement if resistance levels hold, warranting caution for bearish reversals.

The leading crypto asset’s price currently stands at $62,792, reflecting a slight increase within the 24-hour range from $60,776 to $63,156. Despite a recent 2% uplift, bitcoin remains down by 3.6% over the week, showcasing the volatility and uncertainty inherent in the current market. The BTC/USD daily chart underscores a phase of consolidation with a bearish slant. After peaking near $71,287 on April 10, bitcoin’s price corrected to a potential bottom around $56,500. The latest rebound seems to lack volume-backed conviction, suggesting that the increase might not have strong support. This scenario indicates potential vulnerability, where the lack of buying pressure could lead to further dips unless more buyers step in. The 4-hour chart offers a glimpse into bitcoin’s short-term recovery attempts. Notably, the price has rebounded from a low of $60,176, testing the resistance near $63,876. The recent activity shows attempts to build support around $62,000. Enhanced volume during bullish rises points to a growing buying interest, which may underpin further upward movements if sustained. On the 1-hour chart, bitcoin’s bullish momentum is more pronounced, with price movements from $60,600 to over $63,200. The increasing volume accompanying these upswings suggests strong buying interest that could drive continued price appreciation in the near term. The current readings from key oscillators like the relative strength index (RSI) at 49 and the Stochastic at 58 give a neutral outlook, indicating no immediate overbought or oversold conditions. However, the negative readings on the awesome oscillator and momentum indicators suggest caution, as they hint at possible downward pressure or weakening trends. The moving averages (MAs) further present a diversified perspective. Short-term exponential (EMAs) and simple moving averages (10-day, 20-day SMAs) suggest bullish sentiment, likely influenced by recent price recoveries. In contrast, the longer-term averages (50-day, 30-day EMAs, and SMAs) indicate bearish behavior, reflective of the broader negative sentiment observed in the daily chart trends. Given the positive signals on the shorter-term charts, such as the 1-hour and 4-hour frames, coupled with favorable moving averages and increasing volume, there is a solid foundation for potential price appreciation in the near term. If bitcoin can sustain support levels above $62,000 and break through the $63,876 resistance, it could trigger further bullish momentum. Despite the recent uptick in buying interest on shorter time frames, the prevailing bearish trend on the daily chart and the mixed signals from oscillators and longer-term moving averages caution against undue optimism. The lack of volume support on key bullish days and the potential for a failed rebound suggest that bitcoin could resume its broader downtrend.

Following an intraday fluctuation ranging from $60,954 to $63,388, at present, bitcoin is coasting along values between $62,861 to $63,272 per unit, suggesting a market grappling with both bullish and bearish sentiments. Bitcoin’s (BTC) market capitalization stands strong today at $1.23 trillion with a trade volume of $25.37 billion over the past 24 hours, reflecting significant trader interest. Bitcoin’s oscillators predominantly indicate neutrality, with the relative strength index (RSI) at 48 and the commodity channel index (CCI) close to zero, suggesting a balance between buying and selling pressures. However, the momentum oscillator at 2353 and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) level at -792 lean towards a bullish signal, hinting at underlying strength. On the other hand, moving averages (MAs) paint a divergent picture: short-term exponential moving averages (EMAs) and simple moving averages (SMAs) for 10 and 100 days suggest bullish opportunities, whereas longer EMAs and SMAs for 20, 30, and 50 days show bearish sentiment, reflecting a market in transition. The 1-hour chart reveals a sharp increase to a peak of $63,876, followed by stabilization around $63,000, indicating a short-term resistance level. Entry could be considered around the support zone of $62,500, particularly if bullish patterns emerge. The 4-hour chart highlights a recent recovery from a low of $60,634, showcasing potential resistance near $65,500. The daily chart underscores a bearish trend from a high of $72,756 to $56,500 over the last month, with a nascent attempt at recovery. This longer view suggests caution, advising investors to watch for sustained bullish signals before committing to longer-term positions. Currently, bulls are aiming to test upper resistance as we approach the weekend, despite encountering some obstacles along the way. The outlook remains optimistic for bitcoin as it shows resilience in testing upper resistance levels. Increased trading activity and positive movements in short-term indicators suggest potential for further gains. Traders should consider strategic entries when the market begins to demonstrate solid signs of upward momentum. Caution is advised due to the mixed signals from longer-term MAs and persistent resistance levels. The prevailing uncertainty, coupled with potential overhead barriers, could limit BTC’s upward progress and increase the risk of a downturn.

The latest downturn has led to the liquidation of about $34.79 million in bitcoin long positions across various derivatives markets. Bitcoin is facing challenges on Thursday, with its price declining 1.9% over the past 24 hours. However, despite this downturn, BTC has seen a 4.8% increase over the past week. Over the past month, though, statistics reveal a 12.4% decrease during the 30-day period. Concurrently, on May 9, BTC’s dominance stands at about 53% of the $2.27 trillion crypto economy. At press time, bitcoin’s market valuation is hovering around $1.2 trillion with around $24 billion in 24-hour trade volume. BTC’s top pair on Thursday is FDUSD as it captures 44% of BTC trades while USDT commands 33%. USD, USDC, and KRW follow those two stablecoins in terms of BTC’s most traded pairs over the last day. Coinglass.com metrics indicate that the downturn in bitcoin’s value has caused a significant amount of long liquidations across derivatives crypto exchanges. $34.79 million in BTC longs were liquidated in 24 hours. On the other hand, during the past four hours, $7.85 million in BTC shorts were wiped out. Across the entire crypto economy, $134.34 million in both short and longs were liquidated during the day. The day’s liquidation figures underscore the volatile nature of leveraged bitcoin trading, emphasizing the risks and rewards inherent in crypto derivatives markets. Moving forward, stakeholders will be closely monitoring bitcoin’s performance as it attempts to stabilize and regain its footing in a dynamic financial landscape.

Despite a decline of 2.1% over the past 24 hours, bitcoin has gained 9.3% over the last seven days. The technical analysis from the 1-hour and 4-hour BTC/USD charts on May 8 paints a predominantly bearish picture. The 1-hour chart underlines a strong downward trend, starting near $64,389 and dropping sharply to about $62,054. This strong negative momentum, indicated by a series of drops, suggests a sustained seller’s market at these levels. Transitioning to the 4-hour chart, we see similar sentiment with price variations, peaking at $65,513 before descending, signaling a short-term exit point for traders holding long positions. Wednesday’s charts further show mixed signals emerging from bitcoin’s oscillators—such as the relative strength index (RSI) and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) levels—which lean towards neutral to bullish signals, hinting at some buying momentum. However, the moving averages from 10-day to 200-day periods show a significant tilt toward bearish sentiment, especially in shorter spans like the 30-day and 50-day averages. This divergence calls for a strategic analysis of entry and exit points, particularly for short-term trading. A look at the daily chart offers a broader context, revealing a bearish sentiment with bitcoin’s price reaching a high of $72,756 on April 7, before a consistent downturn over the last four weeks. The presence of this long consolidation period points to strong selling pressure, reinforcing exit signals for long positions and potential entries for shorts below the $66,000 threshold, where recent attempts to rise above have so far failed. Despite the overarching bearish signals, key indicators on the oscillators such as MACD Levels and RSI hint at underlying strength. If bitcoin maintains support above the 200-day moving average and increased buying volumes, it could potentially pivot toward a bullish breakout. Traders should watch for reversal patterns and increased market participation to confirm the onset of a bullish phase. The predominance of bearish signals across most short to mid-term moving averages, combined with the negative patterns observed in the daily and hourly charts, underscores a strong bearish outlook. The failure to break past critical resistance levels suggests BTC could continue its downward trajectory.

They view the recent price correction as a healthy cleanup of market excesses. Additionally, they highlighted the market’s strength, citing significant inflows into spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and encouraging signs for increased corporate bitcoin investments. Alliance Bernstein’s analysts, Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra, remain confident about bitcoin’s potential to reach $150,000 by 2025 despite recent price fluctuations. They stated: We feel even better about that call and BTC metrics indicate a healthy cycle, still in its early stages. The analysts regard the recent bitcoin dip to approximately $57,000 as a beneficial adjustment that has “cleaned up the excess leverage on futures contracts on crypto exchanges,” thereby enhancing market stability. They believe that BTC “is far from done,” noting that the “risk-reward here remains attractive.” This BTC correction coincided with a shift in U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have recently seen a reversal from outflows to net inflows. The analysts pointed out that even Grayscale’s converted bitcoin ETF (GBTC) recorded its first net inflow on Friday of $63 million after a 78-day streak of outflows, emphasizing: This is significant considering GBTC has been a source of significant and continued selling, which the new 9 ETFs have had to absorb. The analysts also highlighted robust overall inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs over the last three months and new incentives for corporate treasuries to invest in bitcoin. They mentioned a consistent post-halving hash rate, robust transaction fees, and declining prices for bitcoin mining equipment as signs of a healthy bitcoin market. Bernstein predicted in November last year that the price of bitcoin could reach $150,000 by 2025. Chhugani stated at the time that this prediction was driven by optimism about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot bitcoin ETFs. Last month, the firm’s analysts said they “expect bitcoin’s bullish trajectory to resume post-halving, when the mining hash rates have adjusted and ETF inflows resume back.” Do you think the price of bitcoin will hit $150K next year?

With an intraday range swinging from $63,657 to $65,489, traders grapple with a trading landscape rife with both uncertainty and opportunity. As oscillators mostly suggest neutrality with glimpses of buying strength, moving averages present a more divided narrative. On the hourly chart, bitcoin (BTC) displayed a dramatic sequence of price action, soaring to a high of $65,513 before plunging sharply. The presence of strong buying momentum was abruptly disrupted by a significant sell-off, marked by a large drop in price. This volatility suggests a cautious approach, where potential traders should seek full confirmation from bullish patterns before entering. Shifting focus to the four-hour chart, a steadier bullish trend is evident. The chart illustrates a gradual ascent over several days, culminating at around $65,513. This more stable pattern advises traders to consider entry points near the moving averages or former resistance levels now acting as support, around $64,000, ensuring they are aligned with the broader uptrend. The daily chart extends our perspective, showing a strong recovery from the recent low of $56,500. The ensuing bullish upswings underscore a consistent upward momentum. Traders might look to enter trades within the $62,000 to $63,000 range, leveraging prior resistance levels now serving as support, aiming to maximize gains from the prevailing upward trajectory. Oscillators such as the relative strength index (RSI) and Stochastic remain neutral, indicating no extreme conditions in the market. However, the momentum oscillator and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) levels are signaling bullish sentiment suggesting underlying strength. These mixed signals from oscillators necessitate a balanced trading strategy, emphasizing vigilance and readiness to adapt to sudden changes. The analysis of moving averages (MAs) reveals a divided scenario. Short-term averages like the exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA) for 10 and 20 days suggest a bullish stance, reflecting recent price recoveries. Conversely, longer-term averages for 30 and 50 days show a bearish signal, hinting at potential overhead resistance and a need for caution among long-term traders. Based on the analysis of the hourly and four-hour charts, along with the bullish signals from the shorter-term moving averages and selective oscillators, there’s a compelling case for a positive outlook on bitcoin as of May 6, 2024. The market’s ability to recover from dips and sustain upward trajectories suggests that BTC is poised to test and potentially breach the upper resistance levels near $65,500. Conversely, the bearish scenario is underscored by the sell signals from the longer-term moving averages and the significant sell-offs observed on the hourly chart. The mixed signals from the oscillators, coupled with the potential overhead resistance highlighted by the 30-day and 50-day averages, suggest a cautious approach. There is a tangible risk of a pullback, especially if bitcoin’s price fails to sustain the support levels.

He stated: A rally to above $60,000 and then range-bound price action between $60,000 and $70,000 until August. “The price action played out as I expected. U.S. tax season, consternation over what the Fed will do, the Bitcoin halving sell the news event, and a slowdown of U.S. bitcoin ETF asset under management (AUM) growth coalesced over the prior fortnight to produce a well-needed market cleansing,” Hayes detailed. He also pointed out that China’s currency, the CNY “will be devalued, but it won’t be against USD; rather, it will be against gold and bitcoin.” Prior to the Bitcoin halving, Hayes forecasted a decline in BTC’s price post-event. “Given that the halving occurs at a time when dollar liquidity is tighter than usual, it will add propellant to a raging fire sale of crypto assets. The timing of the halving adds further weight to my decision to abstain from trading until May,” he described at the time.

The leading cryptocurrency maintains a market capitalization of $1.15 trillion and has recorded a trading volume of $28.43 billion over the same period. Bitcoin’s daily chart analysis reveals a consistent bearish trend with BTC’s price tumbling from a high of $72,750 on April 7, to a support level of around $56,500 on April 30. Increased volume on downward price movements underscores the bearish momentum, suggesting that the market could see further declines if this support breaks. On the 4-hour chart, bitcoin shows resilience at the $56,500 support level, albeit with modest recovery attempts. Despite minor bullish upticks, the absence of strong buying volumes hints at a potential lack of commitment among buyers to reverse the trend. The 1-hour chart offers an up-close look at intraday dynamics, showing a slight positive trajectory with prices rebounding from $57,062 to around $59,500. However, the mixed ups and downs indicate high volatility and trader indecision. For those engaging in short-term trading, tactical entry and exit around key support and resistance levels—like $57,000 and $59,500—could be advantageous, particularly if momentum indicators shift. Currently, oscillators present a mixed bag with the relative strength index (RSI) and Stochastic suggesting neutrality. Meanwhile, the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) and momentum oscillators indicate potential bullish opportunities. However, caution is advised as the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) level suggests a bearish undertone, reflecting the prevailing negative sentiment seen in broader chart patterns. A review of moving averages (MAs) paints a predominantly bearish picture, with most short to mid-term averages indicating negative sentiment. Notably, both the 200-day exponential and simple moving averages (EMA & SMA) signal a bullishness, providing a glimmer of hope for long-term traders that there might be a bottom forming at these levels. The current resilience observed at key support levels, coupled with positive signals from long-term moving averages and select oscillators, suggests that bitcoin may be poised for a rebound. If buyers can sustain increased volumes and push through resistance barriers, this could potentially ignite a bullish trend. Traders should watch for consistent bullish patterns and volume growth as indicators of strengthening momentum. Despite occasional signs of recovery, the prevailing bearish indicators across most time frames and technical charts signal potential further declines in BTC’s price. The significant volume accompanying downward movements, along with the predominance of sell signals in shorter-term MAs, indicates that the market may not have reached its bottom yet. Traders should remain cautious, considering safeguarding assets or planning strategic exits should the downward trends continue.

The head of digital asset research at the bank attributed this forecast to a mix of crypto-specific factors and broader macroeconomic influences. Additionally, he warned about the risk of liquidation for some spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) positions, emphasizing that over half of them are currently underwater. Standard Chartered Bank believes that bitcoin’s recent fall below the $60,000 mark might signal the beginning of further challenges ahead. Geoffrey Kendrick, who leads the bank’s forex and digital assets research, remarked on Wednesday: BTC’s proper break below $60K has now reopened a route to the $50K-$52K range … The driver seems to be a combination of crypto-specific and broader macro. Kendrick highlighted crypto-specific concerns, including consecutive days of outflows from U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and a tepid response to the recent introduction of spot bitcoin and ether ETFs in Hong Kong. He cautioned: “More than half of the spot ETF positions are underwater and so the risk of liquidation of some of them must be considered as well.” In addition, he partially attributed the recent decline in bitcoin’s price to the low volume of Hong Kong spot crypto ETFs. The Standard Chartered analyst also stressed that aside from crypto-specific concerns, broader macroeconomic trends are exerting pressure on bitcoin’s price movements. He noted the rapid deterioration of liquidity measures, especially in the U.S., since mid-April, adding that assets such as cryptocurrencies, which typically benefit from liquidity, are experiencing the effects of these tightening conditions. Kendrick opined: “Of course, liquidity matters when it matters, but with a backdrop of strong U.S. inflation data and less likelihood of Fed rate cuts, it matters at the moment.” He continued: Re-enter BTC in the $50K-$52K range or if US CPI on the 15th is friendly. Standard Chartered maintains its bitcoin price projections for the current and upcoming years. The bank recently increased its end-of-year forecast for 2024 from $100,000 to $150,000, while also suggesting that bitcoin could potentially reach $250,000 in 2025, contingent on continued strong inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs and potential purchases by forex reserve managers starting this year. Commenting on when his price prediction will come true, Kendrick said: “It may take a little while now. But I think when we get closer to Trump election victory we can rally hard from say Sept. to year-end.” Do you think the price of bitcoin will fall to $50K as cautioned by Standard Chartered’s analyst?

Additionally, he cautioned that economic data provides conclusive evidence that stagflation is not merely a future prospect for the U.S. economy, “but already a current reality.” Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff expressed his opinions on the U.S. economy and bitcoin via a series of posts on social media platform X Wednesday. Commenting on the price of bitcoin dipping below $57K on Wednesday despite massive inflows into spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in recent months, he wrote: Despite all the hype around the bitcoin ETFs, bitcoin is clearly in a bear market. He noted that BTC is “down 23% in dollars, but 33% priced in gold, with one bitcoin now worth fewer than 25 ounces,” asserting: “Turn out the lights HODLers, the party is over.” Schiff has repeatedly criticized bitcoin following price declines. Earlier this month, he announced the end of the bitcoin “fad” as gold prices surged, labeling BTC a gigantic bubble. In addition, U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs have collectively experienced five straight days of outflows, totaling $635 million. Moreover, the economist often voiced concerns regarding the U.S. economy. Schiff conveyed on X Wednesday: Today’s economic data is conclusive evidence that stagflation is not just a future possibility, but already a current reality. “April ISM tanked, as orders tumbled and prices paid soared. Meanwhile, April job openings collapsed to their lowest level in three years,” he detailed. Earlier this month, Schiff cautioned that high inflation was resurging “with a vengeance” and that “significant” interest rate hikes are necessary. He also criticized JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon for underestimating the challenges facing the U.S. economy. In a recent update, he declared: “It’s game over for the Fed … Despite forecasts of Fed rate cuts, long-term interest rates continue to climb. This will exacerbate the inflation issue, which is positive for gold but negative for bonds.” What are your thoughts on Peter Schiff’s perspective regarding bitcoin being in a bear market and the U.S. economy facing stagflation?

With today’s price standing between $57,505 and $58,059 at 8 a.m. ET, oscillators and moving averages predominantly suggest a continuation of this decline.  On the BTC/USD daily chart, the trajectory of lower highs and lower lows underscores a market firmly in the grasp of sellers, with the price peaking previously around $72,756, roughly 24 days ago, before descending to recent lows of $56,500. This pronounced downward movement is marked by strong selling volumes and an absence of notable bullish reversals, signaling an environment ripe for cautious trading strategies. The oscillator data provides further confirmation of the prevailing bearish sentiment. Key indicators such as the relative strength index (RSI), Stochastic, commodity channel index (CCI), and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) all reflect values that typically suggest either neutral to negative outlooks or direct sell signals. Particularly, the momentum indicator’s sharp downturn to -7467 and the MACD’s bearish position of -1510 are noteworthy, indicating a strong negative sentiment in the market that may not reverse in the short term. Currently, BTC’s short-term exponential moving averages (EMAs) and simple moving averages (SMAs) from 10-day to 100-day intervals are all signaling a bearish outlook, suggesting a lack of confidence in immediate price recovery. However, the 200-day EMAs and SMAs diverge from this pattern, offering a buy signal which might indicate potential long-term stabilization or recovery phases. Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart reveals a microcosm of the broader bearish trend, with the significant drops overshadowing slight upticks and demonstrating continued selling activity. Resistance levels near $65,286 have curtailed any bullish attempts, reinforcing the strength of the current downtrend. The support level at $56,500 is crucial; a break below this could offer new entries for bearish positions, whereas a sustained bounce could provide a narrow window for short-term bullish plays. On the 1-hour chart, bitcoin shows finer fluctuations within its broader downtrend. Some stabilization around $56,500 suggests a temporary easing of selling pressure. Should this level hold and the price begin to form higher lows, it could indicate a potential short-term bullish reversal. Nevertheless, continued movement below this threshold would likely exacerbate the bearish sentiment, providing further short selling opportunities. Despite prevailing bearish trends, there are emerging signals that could suggest a bullish reversal for bitcoin. The stabilization around the key support level of $56,500, if sustained, alongside potential higher lows on the 1-hour chart, could indicate a shift in market sentiment. Traders should monitor for increased buying volume and a breach of recent resistance levels, which could validate a bullish entry point for a short-term rally. The overwhelming evidence from multiple time frame analyses and technical indicators continues to support a bearish outlook for bitcoin. The persistence of lower highs and lower lows across daily and shorter-term charts, coupled with strong sell signals from both oscillators and moving averages, suggests that the downtrend is far from over. Traders should prepare for potential further declines, with the possibility of shorting at retracements or breakdowns below critical support levels.

Since then, the price fell below the $62K mark by Monday morning ET, only to climb back above $62,000 by mid-afternoon. It has been nine days since the last halving event and 109 days following the approval of U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. After publishing several posts predicting BTC price outcomes using a group of artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbots, we chose to review our experiment again to evaluate the current forecasts made by a selection of seven well-known chatbots available today. As we enter 2024, bitcoin (BTC) remains steadily above the $60,000 mark, having sustained this level for over 60 consecutive days. On Jan. 10, approximately 11 U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) received approval, with nine of them significantly drawing BTC away from the market. Conversely, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has released a considerable amount of its BTC holdings. Initially setting trade volume records, these ETFs have seen a deceleration in trade activity, and the incoming flows have diminished from their previous levels. The halving event has passed, ushering in the Runes protocol along with unusually high transaction fees exceeding $240 for a day and a half on April 19. Bitcoin miners are experiencing diminished returns, now receiving an average of 3.55 BTC per block. Enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating the launch of the Hong Kong spot BTC and ETH ETFs this week, as well as the potential approval of ETH-based spot ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Setting these developments aside, we consulted seven AI chatbots for their end-of-year bitcoin price forecasts. The prompt used was: This experiment aims to determine the price of bitcoin by the end of 2024. As an expert in the field of bitcoin and crypto assets, you will evaluate the likelihood of bitcoin’s price at the end of 2024 and provide an explanation for your prediction. The global macroeconomic landscape remains uncertain. The current date is April 28, 2024, and bitcoin is currently trading at $62,900 per unit. A total of 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds were approved three months ago in the United States on Jan. 10, 2024. The block reward halving occurred on April 19, 2024, reducing the subsidy from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. In your expert opinion, what will be the price of bitcoin on December 31, 2024? We asked Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet, Openai’s Chatgpt 3 and 4, Mistral AI’s Le Chat, Google’s Gemini, Inflection AI’s Pi, and Microsoft’s Copilot creative mode using the same prompt. Claude 3 Sonnet’s answer:  Bitcoin’s price on December 31, 2024, will likely be around $82,000 per unit. The approval of spot ETFs, increased institutional adoption due to regulatory clarity, and the recent halving event’s impact on supply dynamics will drive the bullish momentum, despite macroeconomic uncertainties. Le Chat’s answer: Given the recent approval of bitcoin ETFs, increased institutional adoption, and the halving event’s supply reduction, I anticipate a bullish trend. However, the uncertain macroeconomic landscape poses risks. Balancing these factors, I predict bitcoin’s price to reach $85,000 by December 31, 2024, driven by demand growth and supply constraints. Copilot’s answer: Chatgpt 4’s answer: Predicting bitcoin’s price precisely is challenging due to its volatility and external factors. However, the approval of bitcoin ETFs and reduced block rewards suggest a potentially higher demand and reduced supply, respectively. This could drive bitcoin’s price above its current level by year-end 2024. Gemini’s answer: Chatgpt 3.5’s answer:  Given increased institutional adoption, ETF approval, and halving effects, bitcoin’s price on Dec. 31, 2024, may trend higher, potentially surpassing $100,000, with ongoing global economic uncertainties driving continued interest in its decentralized store of value properties. Pi AI’s answer:  In light of the block reward halving and the approval of 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States, it’s conceivable that bitcoin’s price could reach new highs by the end of 2024. Barring any unforeseen macroeconomic or regulatory challenges, I predict a potential $80,000 to $85,000 per unit valuation, underscoring continued institutional adoption and growth in the broader crypto asset market.

Currently trading at $62,279, bitcoin has shown a 24-hour range between $61,994 and $63,929. Bitcoin’s (BTC) daily chart presents a stark bearish trend with a series of lower highs and lower lows, suggesting that sellers maintain a strong grip on the market. The presence of bearish downturns hints at a potential slowdown in momentum. However, the declining volume accompanying the price drop leaves room for ambiguity regarding a near-term reversal. Crucial for traders will be the support level at approximately $59,629, which, if breached, could precipitate further declines. Conversely, heavy resistance lies at around $72,756, marking critical points for potential entry or exit strategies depending on market confirmation. The 4-hour BTC/USD chart corroborates the overarching bearish momentum seen in the daily analysis. Notably absent are strong bullish upswings, indicating a lack of buyer control. Current pricing around the midpoint of the recent range offers little in terms of high-confidence trading opportunities. For bearish strategies, potential entries may arise on pullbacks to former support levels now acting as new resistance, particularly if accompanied by increased selling volume. On a shorter time scale, the 1-hour chart via Bitstamp reveals intricate price action and potential intraday trading signals. A consolidation pattern around $61,943 provides a basis for short-term trades. The $63,000 threshold, having been tested repeatedly as both support and resistance, is pivotal for short-term strategy development. A recent spike in trading volume at these levels could herald imminent price direction confirmation, making it a critical area for traders to monitor. The broader sentiment, as reflected by oscillators and moving averages (MAs), is predominantly bearish with the relative strength index (RSI) at 41, indicating neutrality yet leaning towards bearish conditions. Most MAs signal bearish sentiment, particularly noticeable in shorter durations such as the 10, 20, 30, and 50 periods, all suggesting downward price action. However, longer-term views from the 100 and 200-period averages show bullish signals, providing a contrarian stance amidst prevailing market sentiment. Despite the current bearish momentum, the bull verdict highlights the long-term support levels shown by the 100 and 200-period exponential and simple moving averages. If bitcoin can sustain above these foundational supports and the broader market sentiment shifts positively, there could be potential for a gradual recovery. Traders might look for signs of increased buying volume and reversal patterns near key support zones as indicators of a possible upward trajectory. The bear verdict underscores the prevailing downward momentum, supported by the majority of technical indicators across various time frames. With consistent sell signals from both moving averages and oscillators in shorter periods and a lack of strong bullish interventions, BTC is likely to continue its descent. The next key support levels could be tested soon, and if broken, may accelerate the bearish trend, prompting traders to consider short positions or defensive strategies.

Tradingshot, a Tradingview contributor with over 72K followers, has shared insights into where the price of bitcoin is headed. In a post titled “Bitcoin: This Marks the Historic Starting Point,” published on Thursday, Tradingshot employed the Mayer Multiple Mean, a technical indicator that measures bitcoin’s current price relative to its 200-day moving average, to analyze its trajectory. The analyst explained, referencing the chart below, that BTC “has successfully tested and held the Mayer Multiple (MM) Mean (red trend-line) and is now consolidating.” Noting that the green arrows mark “the point where historically the most aggressive part of the Bull Cycle begins,” Tradingshot pointed out that during instances like July 2013 when the MM Mean was marginally breached, the subsequent rebound was “even more impressive and strong.”  Tradingshot further elaborated that by measuring Fibonacci extensions from the MM Mean’s low to the preceding high, it’s clear that Cycle 1 just exceeded the 2.0 Fibonacci level. Cycle 2 then doubled the Fibonacci level of Cycle 1, reaching 4.0, and Cycle 3 doubled that of Cycle 2, attaining 6.0. This pattern suggests that Cycle 4 might reach an 8.0 Fibonacci level, by adding 2.0 to the Fibonacci level of Cycle 3. “We can assume, of course always with the relative degree of uncertainty that Cycle 4 might be +2 Fib more of Cycle 3’s Fib i.e. 6.0 + 2.0 = 8.0,” the analyst wrote, concluding: Unrealistic or not, that gives us a $300,000 projection and is undeniably technical as those are the exact high-to-low measurements at the time it touched the MM Mean.

Amid a wider range between $62,923 and $65,069 over the last 24 hours, traders are grappling with mixed signals across various technical charts and indicators. Bitcoin’s oscillators are predominantly neutral with the relative strength (RSI) index at 46 and other indicators like the Stochastic and commodity channel index (CCI) hovering around similar levels, suggesting a lack of clear directional momentum. Meanwhile, moving averages (MAs) paint a more pessimistic picture, signaling bearish sentiment across most short-term periods such as the 10, 20, 30, and 50-day averages, despite some bullish signals from the longer-term 100 and 200-day averages. The 1-hour BTC/USD chart shows significant volatility without a definitive trend, as price action remains confined within a tight trading range. For short-term traders, entering near the lower range at approximately $62,000 could be considered, leveraging this level as a potential support zone. Conversely, taking profits near the resistance at $66,000 could be prudent, aligning with past price behavior where this threshold acted as a strong barrier. In a more extended view, the 4-hour and daily charts emphasize a persistent downtrend. The 4-hour analysis reveals a series of lower highs and lower lows, a bearish indicator that was punctuated by sharp sell-offs. The daily chart confirms this trend, indicating substantial resistance at the $72,000 level which BTC has struggled to overcome. Long-term traders should remain cautious, possibly waiting for a confirmed bullish reversal before committing to significant positions. Should bitcoin break above the resistance level at $65,391 and sustain this upward movement, it would indicate a significant reversal from the prevailing bearish trend. Such a breakout could propel BTC towards a bullish phase, with the potential to reach a near-term target of $70,000. Traders should monitor for sustained movements above this key resistance, as it would suggest an increasing momentum and a possible shift in market sentiment towards optimism. The consistent bearish signals across most MAs, coupled with a lack of strength in the oscillators, suggest that the bearish trend may persist in the near term. With resistance solidly forming at lower levels than previous highs and significant selling pressure evident, BTC could likely test further downsides, potentially approaching the next main bearish target at $60,000. Traders should remain cautious, considering safeguarding assets and preparing for possible further declines in price.

A Bitwise researcher has explained that the cryptocurrency will likely continue to test its “higher highs” this year and next. He considers regulatory risk to be the primary concern for bitcoin. Bitwise Asset Management has reaffirmed its bullish view on bitcoin. Ryan Rasmussen, a researcher at the asset management firm, offered his perspective on the future of bitcoin following the cryptocurrency’s fourth halving on the Schwab Network Monday. “What’s happening to miners historically after the halving is that you see some consolidation across the industry,” he explained, noting that some miners are not “prepared to handle new economics of what mining looks like as a post-halving cycle.” Sharing his bitcoin price outlook, he described: “From a price perspective, what we generally see is that the year going into the halving and the year following the halving is the best performance year for bitcoin over three or four-year cycle and that’s happened again and again in the past three halving.” While noting that there is no guarantee that the same will happen in the future, he stressed: “We certainly have a great year running up to this halving. We bounced back from those lows of 2022, had a great 2023, we’re off to a great start in 2024, and I do think that we’ll continue to test higher highs here in 2024 and the next year following the halving.” The Bitwise researcher continued: I think we’re just getting started and bitcoin is going to have a great next 12 months. Rasmussen proceeded to discuss the risks surrounding bitcoin. “I think the biggest risk still for bitcoin is the regulatory risk that exists around crypto as an industry at large,” he began. Noting that while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) did approve spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Hong Kong just approved spot bitcoin and ethereum ETFs, he cautioned: “There’s still many, many areas around the world, many regions, that aren’t friendly towards crypto that have a negative outlook on crypto from a regulatory perspective.” Bitwise expects “governments to catch up to bitcoin over time” as BTC’s adoption expands globally. However, the researcher opined: I certainly think regulatory risk is the biggest headwind here. Furthermore, he referenced several macroeconomic factors, such as global conflicts, inflation, and the high debt burden on the U.S. Last month, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan remarked: “Long-term, we believe bitcoin is in a raging bull market.” The executive also stated that the bitcoin bull market won’t end early, expecting an “everything season.” He noted that BTC could top $200K this year, citing “too much demand and not enough supply.” The CEO of Bitwise, Hunter Horsley, is similarly bullish about the future of BTC, stating in February that the cryptocurrency could hit $250K sooner than the firm previously predicted.

Traders face a nuanced landscape on April 22, 2024, as various charts suggest both caution and opportunity. Bitcoin’s (BTC) price today stands at $65,974, with a 24-hour trade volume of $19.6 billion and a market cap of $1.30 trillion. The cryptocurrency has experienced a trading range from $64,364 to $66,504 over the last day. This slight volatility presents a complex interplay of support and resistance levels that traders need to navigate carefully. The relative strength index (RSI) at 50 indicates a neutral momentum, with no clear overbought or oversold conditions. Similarly, other oscillators like the Stochastic and commodity channel index (CCI) also remain neutral, offering no decisive action signals. However, discrepancies arise with the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) showing a sell signal versus momentum suggesting a buy, illustrating the current market’s indecisiveness. Moving averages (MAs) present a predominantly bullish scenario with the exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA) on shorter spans like 10, 20, and 50 days suggesting buying opportunities, despite some bearish signals at the 20 and 50-day SMAs. This indicates a potential bullish undertone but with caution due to the mixed signals at higher periods. On the 1-hour chart, bitcoin shows stability, with established support at $64,294 and resistance at $66,503. The 4-hour chart indicates more variability but shows a recovering trend from a previous downtrend. Potential entry points could be near these support levels if bullish patterns continue, whereas exit points should be considered around established resistance levels or if reversal patterns appear. BTC’s daily chart exposes broader market sentiment with significant volume spikes at trend reversals, hinting at an ongoing struggle between bullish and bearish forces. Long-term support at $59,629 and resistance near the $72,756 peak suggest strategic points for entry and exit, depending on volume-backed breakout or reversal signals. Given the predominantly bullish signals from the shorter-term moving averages and the supportive buying momentum indicated by key oscillators, the outlook for bitcoin remains positive. If the currency maintains support levels and continues to demonstrate strength near resistance points without significant reversal patterns, it could signify a continued upward trajectory. Traders should monitor for sustained breaks above recent highs, especially if accompanied by strong trading volumes, which could confirm the bullish momentum and lead to new highs. Despite the bullish indicators from several moving averages, the presence of sell signals in critical technical markers like the MACD and some longer-term SMAs cannot be ignored. If BTC fails to sustain its recent recovery and starts showing weakness at key resistance levels, coupled with declining volumes, it could indicate a potential reversal to the downside. Traders should be cautious of any bearish reversal patterns emerging at resistance levels, which could signal a shift toward a bearish market phase.

Bitcoin dominated the NFT market this week, contributing $111.8 million to the overall sales since April 14. This week, NFT revenues fell 25.48% compared to the previous week. Losses affected four of the top five blockchain platforms in NFT transactions. Bitcoin maintained the lead with $111.8 million, though its sales fell by 35.63%, as reported by cryptoslam.io. Ethereum also experienced a decrease, with sales falling 20.38% to $49.58 million. Solana’s sales dropped by 17.13% to $34.82 million, whereas Polygon bucked the trend with a 33.21% increase, bringing in $15.4 million in sales.

The second priciest was an Ethereum-based Cryptopunk # 4,473, which sold for $231,801. As the NFT market cools, its fluctuations reflect broader trends in non-fungible token engagement and NFT technology adoption. This week’s downturn underscores a volatile but intriguing landscape, where even dominant platforms like Bitcoin led but still faced sharp declines. Amid these shifts, innovative collections and standout sales continue to captivate enthusiasts, suggesting a persistent allure despite the overall market’s ebb and flow.

JPMorgan analysts, however, stated that they “see downside for the bitcoin price post halving for several reasons.” JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank have weighed in on the potential impact of the Bitcoin halving on BTC’s price and ecosystem. The Bitcoin network completed its fourth halving on April 19. Despite agreement on the halving’s impact being priced in, the two banks diverge on bitcoin’s post-halving price trajectory. Deutsche Bank analysts Marion Laboure and Cassidy Ainsworth-Grace explained in a note Thursday that the Bitcoin halving is “already partially priced in by the market,” noting that the event “has been widely anticipated in advance due to the nature of the Bitcoin algorithm.” While stating that they “do not expect prices to increase significantly following the halving event,” the Deutsche Bank analysts detailed: Looking ahead, we continue to expect prices to stay high due to expectations of future spot ether (ETH) ETF approvals; future central bank rate cuts; and regulatory changes. A recent survey by Deutsche Bank revealed that more than half of respondents anticipate cryptocurrencies to evolve into an important asset class and a method of payment. Furthermore, 10% of those surveyed expect BTC’s price to surpass $75,000 by the end of the year. JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou has also doubled down on his belief that Bitcoin halving has “largely” been priced in. He said Thursday that he expects a near-term decline in the price of bitcoin following the halving, attributing it to overbought conditions and prices that remain higher than the cryptocurrency’s comparison to gold when adjusted for volatility. He also highlighted the subdued level of venture capital funding for crypto projects. The JPMorgan analyst shared: We do not expect bitcoin price increases post halving as it has been already priced in. In fact we see downside for the bitcoin price post halving for several reasons. Last week, JPMorgan cautioned about potential downward risks in cryptocurrency markets, highlighting that Bitcoin remains overbought despite recent price fluctuations. The analyst also cast doubt on the crypto’s ability to achieve parity with gold in investor portfolios. The global investment bank anticipates a potential drop in BTC’s price to $42,000 following the halving.

Presently, numerous runes exist on the Bitcoin blockchain, with several being offered on marketplaces such as Okx and Magic Eden. Since their introduction at block height 840,000, runes have proliferated across the Bitcoin blockchain. The Runes protocol, a novel token standard, facilitates the issuance of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. Unlike BRC20s, the Rune protocol distinguishes itself by attaching to an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) through a protocol message that specifies the output, ID, and amount via the OP_RETURN function. With the activation at block 840,000, the creation of runes has become a priority over traditional financial transactions. Platforms like Ord.io now display a filter showcasing hundreds of Rune-based inscriptions. Additionally, Ordiscan provides a Runes protocol explorer featuring uniquely named tokens such as “UNCOMMON•GOODS,” “DECENTRALIZED,” and “DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON.”  “DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON” was developed by Ord.io’s founder Leonidas and inscribed in a transaction costing 1,258,757 sat/vB as Rune #3. This issuance saw the creation of 100 billion tokens, with 889,806 destined to be airdropped to holders of Runestone non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Casey Rodarmor, originator of Bitcoin’s Ordinal theory and the mind behind the Runes protocol, inspired the inclusion of his name in several tokens.  Runes are now being offered on NFT marketplaces that specialize in rare satoshis and Ordinal inscriptions. Currently, both Okx and Magic Eden feature runes, with Okx experiencing more dynamic listing and sales activities and Magic Eden’s coming soon. At present, a runes collection named THE•TICKER•IS•ELSA leads on Okx with a trading volume of 14.7631 BTC or $943,524, giving it a market valuation of $25 million at a price of $0.031 per token. Another popular collection, SATOSHI•NAKAMOTO or Rune #6, follows closely with 8.24 BTC in trading volume. Each SATOSHI•NAKAMOTO coin trades at $4, and the token is held by over 18,000 owners. The UNCOMMON•GOODS tokens, attributed to Rodarmor, are exchanging hands at $31.95 each, with a total market capitalization just above $459,000. The Runes protocol and its tokens are quite recent additions to the market, and the future of this trend remains uncertain. Substantial investments have been made in minting and securing early runes, driving BTC transaction fees to unprecedented levels, exceeding $245 per transfer. As the Runes protocol continues to integrate itself into the Bitcoin blockchain, its future impact remains a topic of fervent speculation. Anyone can explore runes on marketplaces and through platforms such as Ord.io, as well as the runes segment on Ordiscan. The protocol’s unique approach to token issuance has not only increased transaction fees but has also introduced a new layer of functionality and intrigue to the blockchain. Marketplaces that host runes now serve as pivotal arenas where the value and popularity of these digital assets will be tested. As collectors and traders navigate this evolving landscape, the enduring success of Runes hinges on their ability to maintain interest and utility in a rapidly changing market. The Runes protocol has sparked debate and dissatisfaction regarding its impact on the fee market. At 10:15 a.m., tensions flared on an X Spaces broadcast titled “Sh**coin Apocalypse” concerning proposals to increase the block size as a solution to fee issues. Speakers on “Sh**coin Apocalypse” became noticeably agitated during discussions on block size adjustments, when anyone suggested such changes might ease the fee situation. However, by 10:20 a.m. on Saturday, any mention of block size enhancements was abruptly excluded from the dialogue. What do you think about the debut of the Runes protocol?

The cryptocurrency’s price hovers at around $65,110 on April 19, 2024, reflecting a volatile day for traders after the escalating conflict in the Middle East and ahead of the halving.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) market activity on April 19, 2024, illustrated significant fluctuations within a $5,029 range, ending the day near its high at $65,110. Despite this recovery, oscillators like the relative strength index (RSI) and the Stochastic present a neutral stance, with the commodity channel index (CCI) hinting at oversold conditions. This mixed signal from oscillators suggests traders are still in a wait-and-see mode amidst uncertain market conditions. The daily chart paints a bearish picture with the price descending from a high of approximately $72,756 to recent lows near $59,629. Interestingly, a strong rebound from this low suggests a key support level, although the lack of volume increase on down days might indicate that panic selling has not taken root. This scenario points to potential stabilization, though the bearish trend underscores the need for cautious optimism. Analysis of the 4-hour chart reveals a persistent downtrend marked by lower highs and lows. Nevertheless, the emergence of a bullish engulfing pattern accompanied by substantial volume suggests a possible short-term reversal or pullback. This indicator is a critical sign for traders looking for entry or exit points, although the follow-through on such patterns remains pivotal for confidence in a sustained reversal. On the 1-hour chart, bitcoin’s price shows signs of consolidation after a recent drop, moving sideways as trading volume diminishes. This consolidation phase near a resistance level at $66,000 is crucial, as it could precede a breakout or further declines, making it a focal point for technical traders evaluating short-term movements. Moving averages (MAs) from various timeframes convey a nuanced view: while shorter exponential moving averages (EMAs) like the 10-day and 20-day suggest a selling bias, the longer 50-day, 100-day, and especially 200-day EMAs indicate bullish signals. This divergence reflects a complex interplay between short-term bearish sentiment and a longer-term foundation that could be forming at lower price levels, offering a beacon of hope for long-term traders. Considering the emergence of bullish patterns on the 4-hour chart and positive signals from long-term moving averages, there is a potential for upward momentum if bitcoin can sustain above critical support levels. Investors should watch for an increase in trading volume as a confirmation of bullish sentiment, potentially leading to a retest of higher resistance levels. The persistent bearish trend indicated by the daily chart and the neutral-to-negative readings from key oscillators suggests that caution remains warranted. If bitcoin fails to break above the immediate resistance levels, particularly amid low trading volumes, it could face further declines as short-term traders may look to capitalize on any signs of weakness.

Historically, bitcoin’s price has seen substantial increases following prior halving events. However, there are speculations that this occurrence might not follow the previous pattern. This week, the creator of the stock-to-flow (S2F) price model, Plan B, suggested that this halving event would likely follow the historical trend, implying no deviation from past patterns. The anticipated Bitcoin halving is drawing near, sparking widespread discussions about the potential price impacts in the ensuing months. Since its 2009 inception, Bitcoin has undergone three halving events, each followed by notable price increases. Following the 2012 halving, BTC climbed by 9,500%, and the 2016 halving saw a 3,000% increase in the following year. The price increase after the 2020 halving was more modest, reaching only 650%. Unlike previous events, BTC has already increased by 110% before this upcoming halving. This has led some to consider the current situation as distinct from previous ones. Voices are suggesting that the halving might trigger a ‘sell the news’ event, potentially causing BTC’s price to “slump.” Recently, Bitwise, an asset management company, recently advised caution, indicating that data points to the impending Bitcoin halving as a “sell the news” event. The crypto community is actively engaged in discussions, weighing whether this is truly a ‘sell the news’ or ‘sell the rumor’ scenario. Meanwhile, JPMorgan has projected that BTC could reach $42K post-halving, whereas the global asset management firm Alliance Bernstein has posited a contrary outcome. S2F creator Plan B is confident that the upcoming event will follow historical patterns. “[In my opinion] this Bitcoin halving will NOT be different,” the analyst stressed in an X post on Wednesday. “All bitcoin price increase will again be around the halving. Buying 6 [months] before the halving and selling 18 [months] after the halving (green line) will outperform buy [and] hold. BTC [greater than] $100K in 2024. BTC top [greater than] $300K in 2025.”  In response, Blockstream’s Adam Back commented on Plan B’s analysis. “[I’m] thinking bitcoin [greater than] gold this coming market cycle,” Back stated. Plan B concurred with this perspective. “Agree, bitcoin must take out gold because it will have 2x scarcity/S2F. My ‘BTC top [greater than] $300K’ is the low end of the $250K-$1M range. Last cycle I took the high end and BTC decided to go low end, let’s see how this will work out,” the analyst further noted. Plan B’s insights emerge amid a fervent wave of optimistic forecasts in recent months. This week, a survey by finder.com, involving fintech and crypto experts, projected that BTC is likely to hit a high of around $122,000 this year, and then settle at about $109,000 by year-end. Despite this optimism, a critic pointed out past inaccuracies in Plan B’s forecasts. “Oh well, your predictions did not age too well a couple of years ago,” the individual said. “Aged fine for me,” Plan B remarked, undeterred by the comment. “I made the $55K prediction in March 2019 when BTC was below $4K, so now at $62K, I (and everybody that followed S2F) pocketed a nice 15x,” Plan B asserted.

They explained that the bitcoin price performance will likely continue to be driven by the supply-demand dynamic and continued demand for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), “which combined with the self-reflexive nature of crypto markets is the primary determinant for spot price action.” Global investment bank Goldman Sachs has advised against extrapolating information from past Bitcoin halving cycles to forecast the future price of the cryptocurrency. Goldman Sachs’ FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities) and Equities team stated in a note to clients last week that previous bitcoin bull runs were likely not solely triggered by the mining-reward halving; macro factors probably played a significant role. In the current cycle, the sustained BTC gains may rely on substantial inflows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “Historically, the previous three halvings have been accompanied by BTC price appreciation after the halving, although the time it took to reach the all-time highs differs significantly,” the Goldman analysts detailed, emphasizing: Caution should be taken against extrapolating the past cycles and the impact of halving, given the respective prevailing macro conditions. The investment banking giant further pointed out that the macroeconomic landscape during the previous halvings differed from today’s environment characterized by high inflation and high interest rates. Therefore, for historical patterns to replicate, macroeconomic conditions must favor risk-taking, which is not the current situation. According to Goldman Sachs, Bitcoin halving is a “psychological reminder to investors of BTC’s capped supply.” The bank’s analysts asserted: Whether BTC halving will next week turn out to be a ‘buy the rumour, sell the news event’ is arguably less impactful on BTC’s medium term outlook. “BTC price performance will likely continue to be driven by the said supply-demand dynamic and continued demand for BTC ETFs, which combined with the self-reflexive nature of crypto markets is the primary determinant for spot price action,” they concluded. Despite predictions of a short-term “sell the news” event at the Bitcoin halving, crypto industry leaders including Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan and Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek remain bullish on bitcoin’s long-term prospects.

However, the firm explained that the market likely “prices in the short-term impact of the halving but underestimates the long-term impact,” emphasizing that the data “also suggests that, long-term, the halving may be conducive to price appreciation.” Bitwise Asset Management has published a report, authored by Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan and senior crypto research analyst Juan Leon, about what investors can expect from the approaching Bitcoin halving. “The biggest question surrounding the halving is whether or not the impact of cutting new supply in half is priced into the market before the halving,” they wrote. “On the one hand, halvings should be great for bitcoin’s price, as reducing new supply by half should increase scarcity. On the other hand, we have known when halvings would occur since bitcoin’s inception. In an efficient market, the impact should already be accounted for.” Bitwise emphasized: Rather than dwell in theory, let’s look at the data. On a short-term return basis, the data suggest that the halving is a ‘sell the news’ event. The upcoming halving is expected to bring down bitcoin’s annual inflation rate from 1.73% to 0.85% as a result of the reduction in new block rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoin, the report describes, adding that “At bitcoin’s current price, that implies $11.6 billion of new annual supply removed from the market.” Bitwise further detailed that the price of bitcoin has risen 19.03% on average in the month preceding the halving, compared to 1.70% in the month following the halving. “Zooming out, however, the reverse is true: On average, bitcoin has risen 3,224% in the year following the halving, versus 185% in the year preceding it,” the asset management firm said, while pointing out that those numbers are skewed by the huge return of 8,839% in the year following the 2012 halving. “But ignoring absolute numbers, returns have been higher post-halving than pre-halving in each of the three historical examples we have,” the report notes. While cautioning that “we have limited data” with only three historical examples, Bitwise concluded: Still, the picture they paint is relatively intuitive, suggesting that the market prices in the short-term impact of the halving but underestimates the long-term impact. The data also suggests that, long-term, the halving may be conducive to price appreciation. Bitwise has been bullish on the price of bitcoin. Last month, Hougan said: “Long-term, we believe bitcoin is in a raging bull market.” He expects the April halving to be “the most impactful we’ve seen.” The executive also stated that the bitcoin bull market won’t end early, expecting an “everything season.” He noted that BTC could top $200K this year, citing “too much demand and not enough supply.” The CEO of Bitwise is similarly bullish about the future of BTC, stating in February that the cryptocurrency could hit $250K sooner than the firm previously predicted.

According to the most recent report on bitcoin forecasts, the panel of experts anticipates that bitcoin could attain a value in the six-figure range by 2024. Finder’s latest survey on bitcoin’s (BTC) price involved a unique panel of 31 crypto and fintech experts. The results suggest that BTC could reach a peak of $122,000 in 2024, and then settle at $109,000 by year’s end. Nick Ranga, the senior crypto and forex analyst at Forextraders, attributes the current uptick in BTC’s value to growing institutional engagement. Ranga is among those experts who foresee BTC reaching its zenith once more in 2024, ultimately closing the year around the $100,000 mark per unit. “The primary catalyst of the current crypto bull market has been the vast inflow of institutional capital following the SEC’s approval of the first bitcoin spot [exchange-traded funds] (ETFs),” Ranga remarked. “Demand is already outstripping supply, reportedly by a factor of 10. This is coupled with the anticipated supply shock of the upcoming halving event, where the supply of new bitcoins entering the market is cut in half.” The analyst added: Retail investors are also returning to crypto, with many exchanges reporting an increase in new registrations. The Finder’s survey also forecasts that BTC could climb to $151,000 by the end of 2025 and $567,000 by the close of 2030. Nonetheless, not every expert on the Finder’s panel shared this optimistic view, with 13% arguing that bitcoin is presently overvalued. John Hawkins, a senior lecturer at the University of Canberra, aligns with this perspective, suggesting that the leading crypto asset by market cap might even fall to $20,000 by the end of 2024. “The current run-up in price seems mainly related to the spot ETFs,” Hawkins explained in the finder.com report. “But when the ETFs based on bitcoin futures were launched in [October 2021], the price also reached an all-time high, only to crash over the following year. Having ETFs still does not give bitcoin any fundamental value or legitimate use. It remains a speculative bubble,” Hawkins added. Shubham Munde, a senior market research analyst at Market Research Future, maintains that the halving will drive higher prices. Nonetheless, Munde holds a more conservative view, estimating that BTC will close 2024 at approximately $91,000 to $95,000 per coin. “The halving event is expected to cause a significant surge in [bitcoin’s] price if we compare the previous trends,” Munde said. “[Bitcoin] demand is constantly increasing and hence its value will increase substantially since institutional and retail investors are constantly growing.” The majority (61%) of Finder’s prediction panel recommends purchasing bitcoin prior to the halving event, while 32% suggest holding onto the leading crypto asset, and merely 6% advocate selling. On average, Finder’s panelists estimate that bitcoin will be valued at approximately $109,141 by the end of 2024. The projections in Finder’s recent survey are notably higher than those seen during the extended crypto downturn that lasted through 2022 and into 2023.

Blackrock launched a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the Ishares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), in early January after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. In a blog post titled “The bitcoin halving: What is it? And why does it matter?,” published on Tuesday, Jay Jacobs, Blackrock’s U.S. Head of Thematic and Active ETFs, explained: “The next bitcoin halving is expected to occur around April 20, 2024. After this, the amount of bitcoin created with each new block will fall to 3.125 from 6.25, and daily issuance will fall to about 450 bitcoin from about 900. This process is scheduled to continue until the last bitcoin is mined around 2140.” Jacobs detailed in a video about the Bitcoin halving: “One of the reasons some people find bitcoin valuable is its scarcity. Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed at the discretion of governments or central banks, bitcoin cannot be created endlessly. In fact, bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins.” Besides noting that the Bitcoin halving “creates more scarcity,” Jacobs stressed: The halving underscores Bitcoin’s decentralized, programmatic nature and its resistance to inflationary pressures that traditional currencies often face. Numerous predictions have been made regarding the potential impact of the Bitcoin halving on BTC’s price. Arthur Hayes, former CEO of Bitmex, has cautioned that cryptocurrency prices might decline following the halving. Conversely, crypto exchange Bitfinex anticipates that the halving will boost bitcoin’s price to between $150,000 and $169,000. Meanwhile, analysts at global investment bank JPMorgan suggest that the effects of the halving are already priced in, warning of a downside risk in crypto markets.

Noting that what’s happening in the bitcoin market currently resembles previous cycles, he stressed: “I personally expect great performance within the next six months.” The CEO of crypto trading platform Crypto.com, Kris Marszalek, discussed the potential impact of the upcoming Bitcoin halving and spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the price of bitcoin in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday. “I think there’s a general consolidation phase going on right now, which is similar to the previous cycles. I expect pretty decent action within the six months following the Bitcoin halving,” Marszalek said. Discussing what he expects to happen after the halving given the demand for bitcoin via spot bitcoin ETFs, he said it “improves the overall situation because you’ve got less bitcoin coming into the market that is being sold by the miners … you’re cutting this in half.” However, he cautioned: “It won’t make a difference over a day or two or a week. But over a period of six months, it makes a substantial difference.” He emphasized: One has to always remember that there is this ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ kind of thing. As we approach this date, there may be some selling coming up. Commenting on how spot bitcoin ETFs change the crypto market structure, he affirmed that they “definitely” change it. “Those are flows that were previously not present, so I would say that probably the proportion of bitcoin prices being driven by retail activity or small investor activity versus institutions is changing during the cycle.” He continued: “The things that we should look forward to is the decision-making on bitcoin ETFs and perhaps some other cryptocurrency ETFs or even cryptocurrency in basket ETFs in the future. Because again, this may strengthen the flows.” Earlier this week, Hong Kong gave conditional approvals for asset managers to start spot bitcoin and ether ETFs. When asked whether he expects the price of bitcoin to keep rallying and what might push the price of BTC higher, the Crypto.com boss replied: “Again I think this is a period of consolidation. We’ve seen exactly this, in fact, happening in the previous cycles, so this is an asset that you want to hold for a very long period of time. You should measure it in years, if not decades.

The firm’s analysts described: “We believe it is always new demand catalysts that lead to bitcoin price appreciation in every cycle.” Global asset management firm Alliance Bernstein’s analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra shared their perspectives on the Bitcoin halving in a note to clients on Wednesday. They wrote: We expect bitcoin’s bullish trajectory to resume post-halving, when the mining hash rates have adjusted and ETF inflows resume back (negative to flat flows last 10 days). “Further, integration of spot bitcoin ETFs with wirehouses, RIAs [Registered Investment Advisors] will continue to provide structural demand for bitcoin, in our view. We continue to expect bitcoin to touch a cycle high of $150,000 by 2025,” the analysts added. Bernstein predicted in November last year that the price of bitcoin could reach $150,000 by 2025. Chhugani stated at the time that this prediction is driven by optimism of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to the analysts at Bernstein, the Bitcoin halving event itself doesn’t necessarily lead to automatic price appreciation. They argue that the potential decrease in selling pressure from miners, due to reduced block rewards post-halving, is no longer a significant factor. They emphasized: We believe it is always new demand catalysts that lead to bitcoin price appreciation in every cycle. The Bernstein analysts detailed: “Historically, a bitcoin price breakout has always followed the halving event and sometimes a few months after halving. However, in the current 2024 cycle, the ETF approvals in January led to strong price appreciation pre-halving (BTC 50% up since leading to all-time highs). Only in the last 10 days with slower ETF inflows (and significant GBTC selling), has bitcoin corrected ~15%.” “If the bitcoin price sees a material drawdown — back to $40,000 levels or lower — we could see a more drastic reduction in network hash rate,” they continued. “We believe the chances of this adverse scenario are lower, given structural ETF demand is far from done, in our view ($12 billion actual inflow YTD vs $80 billion inflow estimate over 2024-25).” Do you agree with Bernstein’s analysts about bitcoin?

Bitcoin’s (BTC) current trading price of $62,891 to $63,075 per unit underscores a market grappling with uncertainty, reflected in an intraday trading range between $61,773 and $64,414 over the last 24 hours. The substantial volume of $36.08 billion, coupled with a market capitalization reaching $1.23 trillion, indicates active trading sessions but with a bearish bias as suggested by the prevalent selling actions across several key moving averages and oscillators. The overall market sentiment leans toward caution, influenced by the dominant negative signals.  The array of oscillator values presents a mixed view, where the commodity channel index (CCI) at -129 points toward a buying opportunity, potentially signaling an oversold condition. However, the relative strength index (RSI) at 41 and other neutral indicators, like the Stochastic and the average directional index, suggest a lack of momentum and directional clarity. Notably, BTC’s momentum and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) levels indicate strong sell signals, supporting the bearish sentiment prevalent in the market.  The moving averages (MAs) on various time frames largely advise selling, with both exponential and simple moving averages from the 10-day to the 50-day timeframe indicating a sell bias. This is counterbalanced somewhat by the longer-term 100-day and 200-day averages, where buying signals are evident, suggesting that while short-term pressures are bearish, there may be underlying support for a longer-term upward trend if these levels hold. The 1-hour chart shows bitcoin failing to break the resistance at the $64,636 mark, with a decline indicated by a series of lower closes, pointing to a short-term control by sellers. Traders would be wise to monitor for either a bullish reversal or further confirmation of bearish trends, especially around the critical support level of $61,654. The 4-hour chart reveals broader price swings and a clear downward trend, suggesting bearish sentiment is not confined to shorter intervals. Resistance at $71,236 and support at $61,308 are pivotal for the next movements. Similarly, the daily chart indicates a definitive downtrend but with potential support around $60,760, offering a possible pivot for reversal if bullish signals emerge. Despite current bearish trends, bitcoin’s resilience at key support levels, particularly around $60,760, may herald a potential reversal. If buyers can consolidate strength and initiate a bullish pattern at this critical juncture, coupled with favorable indicators from long-term moving averages, there might be a robust opportunity for an upward trajectory. Traders should remain vigilant for signs of a momentum shift that could spark a bullish revival in the coming days. Bitcoin’s prevailing downtrend is corroborated by multiple technical indicators, from MAs suggesting continued sell signals in the short to medium term to oscillators that indicate a lack of buying momentum. The consistent formation of lower highs and lower lows across several timeframes paints a grim picture for the immediate future of bitcoin. Traders might consider preparing for further declines, especially if the price breaches the crucial support level at $60,760, potentially triggering a steeper sell-off.

Meanwhile, he said that bitcoin is in a bear market and the price of the cryptocurrency “is going much lower than this.” Economist and gold advocate Peter Schiff has offered insights into the rising price of gold and cautioned against investing in bitcoin and spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “Gold is rising because the dollar, the euro, the yen — fiat currencies are losing value. Inflation is real. It’s here to stay. It’s not going anywhere near the Fed’s 2% target. We’re headed in the wrong direction,” he described in an interview with Fox Business on Monday. Schiff added: We’ll probably be in double digits by next year, and eventually, the first digit isn’t going to be one. “Central banks are out in front of this. They’re the main buyers,” he emphasized. The gold bug proceeded to comment on investors selling gold to buy bitcoin or spot bitcoin ETFs. “A lot of Americans have been foolishly selling their gold to buy these bitcoin ETFs,” he said. “Bitcoin is not going up. In fact, bitcoin peaked two and a half years ago at about 37 ounces of gold. As we speak now it’s worth less than 27 ounces. That’s a 27% decline in two and a half years. This is a bear market. Bitcoin is going much lower than this.” When presented with the fact that bitcoin has significantly outperformed gold, Schiff exclaimed: Bitcoin’s outperformed everything, so don’t compare it to gold. It’s outperformed stocks, real estate, bonds, collectibles. He quickly clarified: “That’s because it’s a gigantic bubble.” Schiff consistently criticizes bitcoin and spot bitcoin ETFs. In February, he also cautioned against a potential bitcoin ETF bubble, predicting a bitcoin price crash coinciding with a surge in gold. He also warned of a possible bitcoin pump-and-dump scenario, anticipating a significant downturn in BTC. Veteran investor Peter Brandt recently challenged Schiff’s statement about gold outperforming bitcoin, stating: “Come on Peter, put things in a broader perspective. I like gold too — I am long a bunch — but which racehorse has done better since BTC’s inception? What do you think about Peter Schiff’s statements about gold and bitcoin?

He emphasized that bitcoin is “still an early stage technical asset that will trade like other risk assets until it exceeds a billion users.” Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci responded to concerns from some critics who argue that bitcoin is neither an inflation hedge nor a store of value, especially after the cryptocurrency’s recent decline during the Middle East conflict. “It’s important to remember that it’s neither of those at the current percentage of global adoption,” he explained, emphasizing that bitcoin is “still an early stage technical asset that will trade like other risk assets until it exceeds a billion users which should happen by the end of 2026, if not sooner.” The Skybridge Capital founder stressed: It will be both of those as it scales. “Moreover, with the U.S. dollar losing 22% of its value since January 2020 and bitcoin going up in value since then, it would be unfair to suggest that bitcoin doesn’t currently have some inflation hedging features. It is however volatile,” he opined. Noting that “there is a charge against bitcoin that it’s already 15 years old and so therefore it is no longer a new asset,” Scaramucci stressed: “I would like to remind people that the Wright brothers demonstrated flight in 1903. By 1918, there were still critics suggesting that there would be no commercial viability of flight.” He concluded: It pays to be long this asset and patient. Earlier this month, Scaramucci stated that the Bitcoin halving is not yet priced in and BTC has “a lot more” upside. He has also repeatedly stressed that it is still very early to buy bitcoin, expecting a “face-ripping rally” incoming.

Discussing the halving, which is “seen as a bullish catalyst for crypto markets,” he described: “I agree that it will pump prices in the medium term; however, the price action directly before and after could be negative.” The former Bitmex chief noted: “The narrative of the halving being positive for crypto prices is well entrenched. When most market participants agree on a certain outcome, the opposite usually occurs.” Hayes opined: I believe bitcoin and crypto prices in general will slump around the halving. “Given that the halving occurs at a time when dollar liquidity is tighter than usual, it will add propellant to a raging fire sale of crypto assets. The timing of the halving adds further weight to my decision to abstain from trading until May,” Hayes detailed. He explained that the “precarious period for risky assets” is from April 15 to May 1. “This is when tax payments remove liquidity from the system, QT rumbles on at the current elevated pace, and [Treasury Secretary Janet] Yellen has yet to start running down the TGA [Government’s Treasury General Account].” Hayes further shared that after May 1, “it’s back to regular programming … asset inflation sponsored by Fed and U.S. Treasury financial shenanigans.” The former Bitmex CEO believes that “April will experience extreme weakness in risky asset markets.” He noted: “For those intrepid enough to short crypto, the macro setup is favorable.

His prediction hinges on spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) investors fully deploying their assets based on recommendations from asset managers. “These are very conservative numbers. Bitcoin will beat gold cap when ETFs have completed their role,” he stressed. Popular onchain analyst Willy Woo shared his analysis on social media platform X on Monday following the news of Hong Kong’s regulator approving spot bitcoin and ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Meanwhile, U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, launched in early January, continue to attract significant inflows. Commenting on the impact of spot bitcoin ETFs on the price of BTC, the analyst explained: The new bitcoin ETFs bring price targets of $91K at the bear market bottom and $650K at the bull market top once ETF investors have fully deployed according to asset manager recommendations. “These are very conservative numbers. Bitcoin will beat gold cap when ETFs have completed their role,” he added. However, the analyst noted that his price estimates are not targets for this cycle because “it takes a long time for capital deployments to complete.” Explaining his “back of the envelope calculations,” Woo detailed that asset managers manage about $100 trillion and they generally recommend a 2% allocation in portfolios, citing Fidelity as an example. “This number will rise over time, but today it’s a $2T allocation into BTC,” he pointed out. “BTC currently holds $561,159,959 of investment (we can measure this on-chain), new total will bring it to $2.56T of investment,” Woo continued. “We can use MVRV [Market Value to Realized Value] to calculate market cap vs money invested. This ratio is 5x in bull market tops and 0.7x in bear market bottoms.” The analyst emphasized: This translates to capitalisations of $12.8T and $1.8T respectively or $650K and $91K per coin. Noting that he has excluded other self-custody inflows which “are way bigger right now,” he said his method is “absolutely a lower bound estimation.” Woo concluded: “Bitcoin will certainly exceed gold capitalisation by the time asset manager capital has deployed. Gold went on a 12-year bull run when its ETF was approved, now it’s bitcoin’s turn.” What do you think about the analysis by Willy Woo?

Despite the current market indecisiveness indicated by the 1-hour chart, the 4-hour and daily charts suggest underlying movements that could influence future price actions. The 1-hour chart displays a consolidation phase with BTC prices oscillating between $62,773 and $66,797, creating a zone of uncertainty for traders. The appearance of a recent significant upswing hints at potential bullish momentum, yet the subsequent mixed patterns signal a cautious market sentiment.  Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart captures more volatility with notable price swings, essential for understanding broader market directions. Although a rebound was observed, the failure to surpass previous highs at $71,287 suggests a lack of strong bullish conviction. Traders should consider entries on sustained breaks above this level, while a dip below $61,308 could signify a shift to bearish momentum, warranting an exit to prevent losses.  Extending our view to the daily chart, bitcoin’s recent recovery from a steep drop to the $60,000 range reveals a market testing its resilience. The long wicks on recent candles underscore ongoing volatility and traders’ indecision. A strategic entry might be warranted if prices push above recent highs, which could mark the start of a recovery phase. Conversely, a breach below $60,760 would confirm bearish dominance, acting as a cue for exits. A comprehensive look at bitcoin’s moving averages (MAs) reveals a split sentiment; shorter-term averages like the exponential (EMA 10, 20, 30) and simple (SMA 10, 20, 30) suggest selling pressure, whereas longer-term averages (EMA and SMA 100, 200) indicate buying signals. This divergence calls for attention to longer-term bullish signals amidst short-term sell-offs. Oscillators like the relative strength index (RSI) and Stochastic are currently neutral, providing little directional bias. However, the moving average convergence divergence’s (MACD’s) bearish signal juxtaposed with the momentum indicator’s bullish signal presents a conflicting scenario, urging traders to wait for more pronounced signals before making significant moves. With a market capitalization of $1.30 trillion and a 24-hour trade volume of $45.24 billion, bitcoin’s substantial capital flow indicates strong market interest. However, the overall neutral stance of most oscillators combined with mixed signals from moving averages suggests that the market is in a state of flux, potentially gearing up for its next major move. Given the current consolidation and subtle signs of an upward break in the shorter time frames, coupled with long-term bullish signals from moving averages, there is a reasoned optimism for a potential bullish resurgence. Should bitcoin sustain a break above the critical resistance levels noted in the 4-hour and daily charts, it could signify the beginning of a robust upward trajectory. Conversely, the prevalence of sell signals across several short-term moving averages and the neutral-to-negative indications from key oscillators suggest that downward pressures remain significant. If bitcoin fails to maintain its current support levels and breaches the lower thresholds discussed, it would likely confirm a bearish trend.

The famous author stated this week that he believes the price of bitcoin will reach $2.3 million. While demand for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is soaring in the U.S., the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has explained why he will not invest in spot ETFs. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries. He wrote on social media platform X on Friday: “Q: Will you buy the bitcoin ETF?” He then answered his own question: No. Just as I own gold and silver coins and mines and own apartment houses, I do not own gold or silver ETFs or REITs, real estate ETFs. “ETFs are best for most people and institutions. Personally, I am an entrepreneur and prefer to stay as far away from Wall Street’s financial products as possible,” he added. “Packaging my own financial products is best for me because packaging my own securities requires me to be smarter than most ETF buyers. It is what is best for me. If I F’ up, I have no one to blame but me. The more important question is ‘What is best for you.’” Despite his current stance against spot bitcoin ETFs, Kiyosaki previously advocated for them as an alternative for investors hesitant to buy actual bitcoin. Recently, Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful, also reiterated his view that he will not buy a spot bitcoin ETF. “I would never do that. Why would I pay the fees? There’s no added value to an ETF. I just own the coin directly,” he emphasized. Kiyosaki calls himself a bitcoin bull. He revealed this week that he believes the price of bitcoin will reach $2.3 million, citing a prediction by Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood. Last week, he responded to a prediction by economist Harry Dent stating that the price of bitcoin could crash to $200. “If bitcoin drops to $200 per coin I will buy as many coins as I can,” he affirmed. The renowned author has also intensified his advice for investors to ditch the U.S. dollar to buy bitcoin alongside gold and silver. He views BTC as the perfect asset at the right time while calling the USD a “giant Ponzi scheme.” Earlier, Kiyosaki predicted that the price of bitcoin would hit $100K by September, emphasizing the importance of the halving.

The price of bitcoin in USD tumbled to an intraday low of $65,230. Over the past 24 hours, leveraged crypto positions totaling $871.88 million were eradicated. Currently, the value of the cryptocurrency market is approximately $2.42 trillion, following a 7.4% decrease over the last day. The volume of global crypto trades surged by 35.83% on Friday, reaching $114.57 billion. Before 8 a.m. on Friday, bitcoin (BTC) was trading above $70,000, and it briefly jumped above $71,000 during the early morning trading sessions. However, resistance quickly emerged, causing the price to falter and subsequently fall sharply at 2:00 p.m. The 1-hour candle at 2:00 p.m. recorded a drop to a low of $65,230 per bitcoin. The price managed to record a slight rebound from this low and is currently trying to claim the $67,000 mark. This downturn also impacted the broader market, as bitcoin’s significant price drops often influence the entire crypto economy.  Bitcoin is down 4.8% today and has fallen 8.8% against the U.S. dollar over the past month. The market volatility on Friday further led to a notable number of liquidations among crypto traders using leverage. Around 275,000 crypto traders experienced liquidations, with total losses approaching one billion.

The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily scale sits at a neutral 56, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions, suggesting that BTC has room to maneuver in either direction without immediate pressure from traders. Meanwhile, other oscillators like the Stochastic and commodity channel index (CCI) present neutral to mildly bullish signals, pointing to potential upward momentum without significant overextension. On the other hand, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) level shows a bearish signal. A detailed look at the moving averages (MAs) underscores a strong bullish sentiment across various time frames. Both exponential moving averages (EMAs) and simple moving averages (SMAs) from 10-day to 200-day periods are all signaling positive sentiment. This unanimity among short-term and long-term averages highlights a robust underlying strength in Bitcoin’s price trajectory, potentially indicating sustained bullish activity ahead. On the 1-hour chart, bitcoin displays marked volatility, with its price fluctuating between $69,550 and $71,287. This chart is particularly vital for day traders as it highlights critical points for entering and exiting trades. For example, a revisit to the lower limit of $69,550 could present an appealing opportunity to buy, whereas reaching the peak of $71,287 might suggest a favorable moment to sell and benefit from the short-term price movements. The 4-hour chart provides a more extended view, spanning several days, and pinpoints crucial support at $67,482 and resistance at $72,756. This wider lens is essential for evaluating the mid-term trajectory of the market. Traders might consider buying on dips to the strong support level or starting trades on a climb above $72,756, indicating the potential for continuing the upward trend. Long-term analysis through the daily chart reveals a consolidation pattern, with significant historical support at $60,760 and recent peaks around $73,794. This chart is key for formulating long-term strategies, where a daily close above the recent highs might indicate a bullish trend, prompting trades based on anticipated prolonged upward movement. Given the strong support from moving averages across multiple time frames and the neutral to bullish signals from various oscillators, the outlook for BTC remains optimistic. The consistent bullish signals from both short-term and long-term averages, coupled with the ability to maintain key support levels, suggest that bitcoin is positioned for further upward movement. Despite the bullish indicators from MAs, the mixed signals from oscillators like the MACD and momentum should not be overlooked. The presence of a bearish signal in the MACD level and only a neutral stance in other key oscillators could indicate underlying market hesitations. If BTC fails to hold critical support levels or shows weakness at resistance points, this could signal a potential reversal or a slowdown in upward momentum.

Nonetheless, he stressed: I too believe bitcoin will reach $2.3 million. “I suggest ‘Live dangerously.’ If you can afford $.01 bitcoin… you will be better educated, smarter, wiser when it comes to bitcoin,” he opined. Wood and her asset management firm, Ark Invest, have made a bullish BTC price prediction that is even higher than what Kiyosaki quoted. “We put our bull case for bitcoin at $1.5 million,” the Ark CEO recently said, adding that “If institutional investors were to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolios to bitcoin, that alone would add $2.3 million” to her firm’s $1.5 million projection. In addition to the surging demand for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Wood recently highlighted other factors that are driving the price of bitcoin higher. She said the cryptocurrency is a hedge against currency devaluations and wealth erosions. “I think this is an insurance policy against rogue regimes or against just horrible fiscal and monetary policies,” she detailed, attributing the recent bitcoin price surge to a “flight to safety.” Kiyosaki has also repeatedly warned about markets crashing. “The Everything Bubble, stocks, bonds, real estate set to crash.

PUPs BRC-20 NFTs were ranked second with sales nearly topping $4.5 million.  In total, six Bitcoin-based NFTs were among the top ten collections with the largest volumes. Two Solana-based collections, one each for Avalanche and Mythos, completed the top ten collections for the seven-day period under review. Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), ranked 11th, was the highest-ranked Ethereum-based NFT with sales volumes of $794,500. Meanwhile, the Cryptoslam data further shows that despite the surge in sales volumes, the number of transactions decreased by 21.65% to 1,676,393. In the same period, both wash volumes and wash transactions fell by 28.03% and 32.13%, respectively. As reported by Bitcoin.com News, NFT sales volumes had been declining before the uncharacteristic surge. Some experts believe the rise of real-world assets and NFTs with built-in utility may explain investors’ renewed interest in NFTs. Alina Krot, CEO of 10101.art, also linked the renewed interest to NFT innovations promising even better returns. “Owning such NFTs grants access to exclusive communities, events, or in-game items, making them more attractive for individuals. Also, innovations, such as collective ownership of NFTs and integration with the Metaverse are drawing investor interest by offering new financial opportunities with a potential for higher returns,” Krot said. Regarding the general decline of the NFT market, which has led some traditional companies and institutions to scale back or abandon NFTs, Krot attributed the cool-off to what she termed as oversaturation. The CEO added that as the NFT market matured, prices fell back to more realistic levels. Looking ahead, Krot said the NFT market is anticipating a revolution in real-world assets, where art tokenization will become the trend. Are NFTs about to stage a comeback?

Oscillators and moving averages paint a complex picture of neutrality and cautious selling signals, amidst a backdrop of a $1.35 trillion market capitalization. Bitcoin’s stance of neutrality and period of consolidation precede the release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. As bitcoin (BTC) hovers around $69,028, its 24-hour trade volume reaches $32.92 billion, highlighting a day filled with trading fervor. The broad range of intraday prices reflects a market in search of direction, underpinned by a substantial market capitalization of $1.35 trillion. This liquidity and volatility create a fertile ground for both short-term traders and long-term investors to reevaluate their positions. BTC oscillators, including the relative strength index (RSI) and Stochastic, currently signal neutrality, suggesting a market in balance. However, the momentum and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) level indicate sell signals, hinting at the potential underlying bearish sentiment. Meanwhile, moving averages predominantly advocate for bullish action, with both the simple (SMAs) and exponential moving averages (EMAs) across various timeframes leaning towards a bullish outlook, albeit with a cautionary note from the 10-day EMA.  Analyzing the daily chart, the witnessed volatility with peaks and troughs signals a market grappling with its next move. The consolidation phase, characterized by smaller market movements, points towards indecision among investors. Without a clear bullish signal, the current stance leans towards a watchful waiting.  The 4-hour chart offers insights into a short-lived rally and subsequent downturn, suggesting a market searching for equilibrium. The balance between buying and selling forces, as evidenced by the mix of ups and downs, highlights a critical period of indecision. For those looking to enter the market, identifying a breakout or support level bounce could serve as a key strategy, with volume as an essential confirmation indicator. The hourly chart reveals a more nuanced view of bitcoin’s price action, showing a downtrend punctuated by lower highs. This granularity allows for the identification of potential bullish reversal patterns or the consideration of exits should the downtrend continue, marked by the recent low of $68,217. This level serves as a pivotal point for traders to gauge the market’s next direction. The analysis of bitcoin’s market behavior on April 10, 2024, amidst the backdrop of neutrality in oscillators and a strong leaning towards buying in moving averages, suggests underlying strength. Despite the daily chart’s indecision and the mixed signals from the hourly and 4-hour charts, the predominance of bullish signals across various moving averages, coupled with the resilience in bitcoin’s price above significant historical support levels, indicates potential for upward momentum. Despite the apparent equilibrium in market sentiment as indicated by the neutral stance of most oscillators and the bullish bias in moving averages, the presence of sell signals from key indicators such as the momentum and MACD Level, combined with the recent downtrend in the hourly chart, signals potential underlying weakness in bitcoin’s market structure.

Coinbase Institutional’s research team discussed various topics, including bitcoin and the impact of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), in their latest Weekly Market Commentary, published Friday. “In our view, bitcoin’s increased acceptance as a form of ‘digital gold’ could enable demand from a new subset of investors in this market regime,” the crypto firm stated, elaborating: As a result, we think dips are likely to be more aggressively bought compared to previous cycles, even as volatility persists during price discovery. Moreover, Coinbase noted that bitcoin’s broader access to capital as a result of the launch of U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs “could also contribute to dampened volatility (relative to previous cycles) in our view.” The crypto exchange continued: The impact of these ETFs and the larger inflow of institutional demand can be seen in the open interest of bitcoin futures, which can be used as hedging instruments. Coinbase highlighted that the CME bitcoin futures open interest at $9.9 billion has surpassed that of any single centralized exchange (CEX) and accounts for more than one third of the entire bitcoin futures market (including both perpetual and fixed futures). “In our view, the capital unlocked by the ETFs perhaps represents the most fundamental shift in market structure between the previous 2020-21 cycle and today. These capital unlocks, coupled with the upcoming Bitcoin halving (estimated to occur on April 20-21 subject to variations in network hash rate) and other positive catalysts, make us still largely constructive in our view throughout Q2,” the crypto exchange detailed.

Discussing why the price of bitcoin surged “dramatically,” the Ark Invest CEO highlighted that “There’s something else going on around the world” besides the impact of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “There are currency devaluations taking place that people are not talking about. The Nigerian naira is down 50%-60% in the last nine months, Egypt just devalued by 40%, Argentina continuing to devalue,” she detailed. Wood opined: I think this is a flight to safety, believe it or not, taking place — a hedge against devaluation, a hedge against a loss of purchasing power and wealth. That’s very important. “And we saw this even here last year in the United States,” she noted, adding: “Regional banks imploded, bitcoin went up 40%.” Emphasizing that “Bitcoin does not have counterparty risk,” Wood explained that the cryptocurrency is both a risk-on and a risk-off asset. The Ark Invest chief concluded: I think this is an insurance policy against rogue regimes or against just horrible fiscal and monetary policies. Wood said earlier this year that based on her firm’s research, “the probability of the bull case has increased” for BTC with spot bitcoin ETF approvals. “Our bull case is $1.5 million by 2030,” she affirmed.

With a 24-hour trading volume of $29.64 billion and a market capitalization soaring to $1.41 trillion, the cryptocurrency showcases strong market growth.  Analyzing the daily chart, bitcoin (BTC) displays a bullish pattern with consistently higher lows and higher highs, indicating a robust uptrend. The latest rise breaking past potential resistance levels suggests a fervent buying interest among traders. However, the wisdom of waiting for a retracement or consolidation becomes apparent, aiming to avoid entering a peak post-major bullish run-up. The 4-hour chart offers a detailed perspective of bitcoin’s ongoing ascent, backed by an increasing trading volume—a bullish signal. While the chart emphasizes strong buying pressure through large upswings, it mirrors the daily chart’s advice: the prudent strategy involves waiting for a pullback or a period of consolidation, ensuring a more favorable entry point for traders. The hourly chart uncovers a steep price surge, potentially signaling overextension. Accompanied by a spike in volume, this rapid ascent underscores the move’s strength. Yet, such sharp increases often lead to short-term pullbacks, suggesting that traders should seek consolidation or a slight dip before making an entry. A mixture of bullish signals across most moving averages (MAs) and oscillators like the awesome oscillator and momentum oscillator indicates strong positive sentiment. Nonetheless, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) presents a bearish signal, urging traders to remain cautious and seek confirmation before proceeding. With most oscillators positioned neutrally, the market sentiment leans towards stability with a side of optimism. The bullish actions recommended by MAs across various periods reinforce the optimistic outlook, advocating for strategic entries post-consolidation to maximize potential gains. The technical analysis of BTC’s April 8, 2024 performance distinctly favors a bullish outlook. The convergence of moving averages and oscillators, alongside volume growth and a clear uptrend across multiple time frames, signals robust buying pressure and investor confidence. Despite the MACD’s bearish signal, the overwhelming consensus among other indicators suggests this could be a minor hiccup in a broader upward trajectory. While the immediate outlook for BTC on April 8, 2024, seems overwhelmingly positive, a cautious analysis reveals underlying risks that could tilt the scale toward a bearish correction. The sharp ascent observed, especially in the shorter time frames, raises concerns about overextension and potential pullbacks. The MACD’s negative signal, in the context of otherwise bullish indicators, could foreshadow a forthcoming reversal as the market digests recent gains.

He emphasized that bitcoin has significant room for further growth, noting that the crypto could “trade to half of the valuation of gold,” which translates to a potential six to tenfold move from its current price. Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci discussed his bitcoin outlook in an interview with CNBC Friday. He explained that the demand for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) “was a big reason” for the recent rebound in bitcoin’s price. “The regulatory hurdle where the United States government is now allowing a CUSIP to be attached to bitcoin is a big reason and … when Wall Street gets a product like this, it’s like a selling machine and it’s generating lots of demand for the product,” he detailed. While some argue that the impact of spot bitcoin ETFs has already been factored into the price of BTC, Scaramucci disagrees. He emphasized: They’re now saying that the halving is priced in. I don’t believe that. I think bitcoin has a lot more to go here. Commenting on the record-breaking demand for spot bitcoin ETFs, the Skybridge founder opined: “I think we were surprised that there’s over $10 billion in the first quarter of new flows for something like bitcoin.” He explained that he was surprised because “it took a year for GLD, the gold ETF, to get to $10 billion and so this did it in 25% of the time.” Scaramucci continued: “The Bitcoin network spits out about 900 coins a day. That’s going to get cut in half, probably on April 20th or so. And so you’re going down to 450 coins and you probably have 2,000-3,000 coins of base demand at a time when the supply is going to get cut.” Commenting on how high he sees the price of bitcoin reaching, the Skybridge founder shared: I’m just simply saying it could trade to half of the valuation of gold, which is a six to eight [to] 10 times move from here. “Typically, what’s happened over the 18 months since the halving, you get a 4x move in bitcoin. Let’s be a little bit more conservative than that. I’ve been saying that it’s about $170,000 for this cycle,” he explained.

I recommend the same for you and your family.” The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has responded to some predictions by economist and best-selling author Harry Dent, including one about bitcoin’s price crashing to $200. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries. “Harry Dent is predicting the biggest ‘everything’ crash is coming. He is saying the ‘Baby Boom Generation’ will be the biggest losers, as their homes crash in value. He says the S&P will fall by 80%,” Kiyosaki stated on X Tuesday. “If Harry is correct I will simply buy more real estate, gold, and silver.” Moreover, the famous author explained that Dent predicts that the price of BTC is going to crash. “He also predicts bitcoin will drop back to $200 a coin,” Kiyosaki claimed, emphasizing: If bitcoin drops to $200 per coin I will buy as many coins as I can. “If Harry is right … those who are prepared will soon be multi-millionaires and possibly a few new billionaires. I hope Harry Dent is right. Even if he isn’t, those who are holding gold, silver, and bitcoin will be richer,” the acclaimed author opined. He then reiterated that gold and silver are God’s money while bitcoin is people’s money. In contrast, he warned that “the dollar is fake money.” In a follow-up post on X this week, Kiyosaki commented on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s statements regarding inflation. “Fed Chairman Powell finally told the truth. Last week he finally admitted inflation is winning. The Fed can no longer promise inflation at 2% or that inflation is ‘transitory.’ Again he finally stopped lying. Congratulations,” the renowned author detailed. However, he cautioned: “The problem is most people have no idea what the Fed Chairman admitted means to them or their families or to the world.” Emphasizing that “Savers are losers,” Kiyosaki noted that the U.S. dollar “has lost 95% of its purchasing power since 1913.” Kiyosaki urged investors: “Please wake up and take control of your money and your information. If you trust our political leaders you are in trouble financially. Please take control of your financial teachers and your money.” He stressed: I am a hard, real money advocate, and I only save real gold, silver, and bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s 1-day chart reveals a narrative of volatility, with the asset’s price making significant leaps and bounds. This volatility is encapsulated by long wick candles, highlighting the intense tug-of-war between buyers pushing upwards and sellers pulling down. A bullish pattern or a close above preceding highs might serve as a beacon for entry, while bearish signs or a drop below recent consolidation lows could indicate a timely exit. Zooming into the 4-hour chart offers a granular view of bitcoin’s price action, revealing patterns of consolidation interspersed with attempts at breaking out. The resilience of the support level around $64,511 stands out, hinting at a strong base that buyers are keen to defend. Conversely, a break below this support, marked by significant volume, may suggest a shift in the balance towards the bears, prompting considerations for exit. The 1-hour chart provides an immediate snapshot of bitcoin’s price fluctuations, illustrating a slight downward trend and emerging resistance levels. Entry opportunities might be gleaned from clear indicators of trend reversal, such as the formation of higher highs and lows, possibly corroborated by moving averages.  The mixed signals from various oscillators, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Stochastic, and commodity channel index (CCI) hovering in neutral territory, contrast starkly against the bearish signals from the awesome oscillator, momentum, and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) level. This divergence suggests a market in flux, where decisive movement is yet to be established. Traders should navigate this landscape with a balanced perspective, weighing the sell indicators against the broader market context. The story told by moving averages (MAs) is one of nuanced contrast. Shorter-term averages advocate for caution, signaling sell, while longer-term averages paint a picture of underlying strength with buy signals. This dichotomy reflects a market that, despite immediate pressures, holds a foundation of long-term optimism. The interplay between these averages can offer strategic insights into entry and exit points, guiding decisions with a blend of short-term caution and long-term confidence. In analyzing the confluence of technical indicators, particularly the strength shown in the longer-term moving averages and the resilience of key support levels on the 4-hour chart, the outlook for bitcoin on April 5, 2024, skews towards bullish. The undercurrents suggest that, despite short-term volatility and neutral oscillator readings, the foundational support and emerging patterns indicate a market gearing up for an upward trajectory. Conversely, a detailed examination of the current state of bitcoin, taking into account the sell signals from several key oscillators and the immediate-term moving averages, paints a cautionary picture. The neutrality of certain oscillators, juxtaposed with the active sell signals from the awesome oscillator, momentum, and MACD level, signals underlying market hesitancy and potential downward pressure.

With a daily trading volume reaching $45.30 billion and a total market value of $1.29 trillion, the cryptocurrency’s liquidity and market breadth still stands strong. However, recent downturns have left traders wary. Currently, bitcoin has declined by 6% this week in comparison to the U.S. dollar. On the 1-hour chart, bitcoin’s (BTC) price trajectory shows a consistent downward trend, signaling a bearish outlook in the immediate term. The market’s moderate volatility within this timeframe suggests some resilience against larger sell-offs, yet the presence of established support at $64,511 and resistance at $69,464 delineates a constrained trading range. This bearish tilt is further corroborated by the 4-hour chart, where a pronounced downtrend is marked by significant bearish drops, pointing towards a consolidation phase with potential downside risk. The 4-hour overview reveals a continuation of the bearish sentiment, highlighted by increased volatility and more substantial price movements. Despite this, the reaffirmed support level at $64,511 and a new resistance point at $71,391 suggest a wider band for potential price action. However, the mid-term analysis also indicates a market in search of direction, as evidenced by the oscillators—most of which hover in neutral territory, though with a slight inclination towards sell signals. On the daily chart, bitcoin presents a complex picture of alternating bullish and bearish patterns, hinting at a broader phase of consolidation. Significant volatility, as marked by extensive price swings, underscores the uncertainty prevailing in the market. Yet, the appearance of the last significant drop suggests a bearish undertone. Support at $59,313 and resistance at $73,794 mark the boundaries of this longer-term phase, offering a glimpse into the critical levels that could define bitcoin’s path forward. The aggregate view from oscillators and moving averages paints a narrative of caution. While the relative strength index (RSI), Stochastic, and other oscillators largely signal neutrality, the preponderance of bearish indications among moving averages—especially in the short to mid-term ranges—hints at underlying negative pressure. Notably, longer-term moving averages suggest a potential for reversal, with positive signals emerging in the 50, 100, and 200-day metrics, reflecting a contrast to the more immediate bearish indicators. Despite the immediate bearish signals, Bitcoin’s technical analysis reveals underlying strengths that could pave the way for a bullish reversal. The emergence of “buy” signals in the longer-term moving averages, especially from the 50-day moving average onwards, indicates a potential for foundational support and upward momentum. The bearish undertones evident in Bitcoin’s short to mid-term technical indicators cannot be overlooked. The predominance of “sell” signals among both oscillators and moving averages in these time frames paints a cautious picture. Moreover, the established resistance levels and the presence of significant bearish candlesticks on the charts suggest that downward pressure may persist. The neutral stance of most oscillators further indicates a lack of strong momentum, potentially leading to further consolidation or a downtrend.

Amidst a trading volume of $27.37 billion, the cryptocurrency giant showcases a current market capitalization of $1.36 trillion. Bitcoin’s current trading landscape, through the lens of oscillators and moving averages, presents a complex picture. Oscillators, including the relative strength index (RSI) and Stochastic, remain neutral, while the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) level suggests a bearish signal, contrasting with the bullish indications from both exponential (EMAs) and simple moving averages (SMAs) across various time frames. This divergence underscores the market’s uncertainty and the latest tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. A significant sell-off on BTC’s 1-hour chart marks a sudden bearish turn, with prices plummeting from around $71,391 to a low of $68,900 per unit. This movement suggests an immediate bearish momentum, advising caution for traders considering long positions. Potential entry points for shorts could emerge if the price retests the breakdown area, with exits planned around the $68,900 mark to mitigate further downside risks. Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart delineates a phase of indecision post a sharp decline, hinting at possible consolidation or a forthcoming reversal. Traders eyeing a bullish reversal should await a clear bullish candlestick pattern or a breach above the $69,500 range. Conversely, a continued failure to surpass recent highs could offer a ripe opportunity for short positions, emphasizing the importance of setting strategic exit points to navigate the volatile market. On a broader scale, BTC’s daily chart indicates that the recent sell-offs are part of a larger, volatile trading range, with no definitive long-term trend in sight. Entry strategies should, therefore, hinge on pronounced bullish or bearish signals, with long positions seeking confirmation through bullish patterns and shorts watching for sustained bearish momentum. Despite the short-term volatility and bearish momentum indicated by the 1-hour chart, the overwhelming support from moving averages across broader time frames paints a promising picture for bitcoin. The majority of moving averages signaling a buy, combined with the market’s resilience in maintaining a high valuation, suggests underlying strength. The immediate bearish signals observed in the 1-hour chart, coupled with the MACD’s sell indication, underscore the potential for further downside in the short term. Despite the optimistic outlook from moving averages, the inability of bitcoin to sustain above critical resistance points signals weakness that bears might exploit.

He explained that based solely on supply and demand, with bitcoin allocation potentially reaching 3%-5% of global assets, “you should see the price of bitcoin being multiples of what it is today.” LMAX Group’s CEO, David Mercer, discussed bitcoin’s future and the influence of surging demand for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in a recent interview with CNBC. LMAX Group is a global financial technology company and a leading independent operator of multiple institutional execution venues for FX and cryptocurrency trading. Mercer explained that if BTC becomes a standard portfolio allocation, with “3%, 5% of people’s portfolios or the assets in the world being allocated to bitcoin,” we’d see a dramatic price increase. “Based purely on supply and demand — and we’ve never seen anything like this before,” he stated: You should see the price of bitcoin being multiples of what it is today … I do think in a longer time horizon — five years, 10 years — then certainly this will be trading in six digits, rather than five digits as it is today. Commenting on the impact of spot bitcoin ETFs and the subsequent appetite for crypto, he shared: “If you look at all the institutions we cover — within the group, we trade with 35 of the world’s top 40 banks, all the major proprietary trading firms in the world, over 200 brokers — the group that we’ve excluded historically have been the banks.” He added. “They could trade the futures but they couldn’t trade the physical. What you’re seeing now is the underlying for these ETFs is the physical.” The executive elaborated: I think overall this democratizes the asset class for everyone. It opens up market access from retail all the way up to institutional. “It means that even the high net worth desks, the private wealth desks in banks, can now offer product which gives you direct exposure to the asset class,” the LMAX chief executive continued. “I think over time as all the institutions become more comfortable with the behavior of the asset class, you’re going to see people getting closer to the asset itself and owning the core asset, which is bitcoin or ethereum or solana.” Meanwhile, a number of people are increasingly bullish on bitcoin, predicting significant price hikes post the upcoming halving. Standard Chartered Bank, for example, raised its BTC price prediction for this year from $100K to $150K.

Its chief executive anticipates the upcoming bitcoin halving to be “the most impactful we’ve seen.” The firm’s chief investment officer explained that global wealth managers allocating just 1% of their portfolios to bitcoin would mean about $1 trillion of inflows into the space. The CEO and CIO of Bitwise Asset Management discussed bitcoin outlook and the upcoming halving event this week. Bitwise launched a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in early January after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. In an excerpt from his weekly memo to investment professionals, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan noted that in the short term, “bitcoin seems likely to chop sideways on small changes in sentiment.” However, he emphasized: Long-term, we believe bitcoin is in a raging bull market. “Not only is it up nearly 300% in the past 15 months but there are strong reasons to think that will continue,” he clarified. “The January launch of spot bitcoin ETFs opened up the crypto market to investment professionals in a major way for the first time ever,” he explained. “These investors control tens of trillions of dollars — globally, the best estimate is over $100 trillion — and they are just starting to move into crypto. This is a process that will take years, not months.” He opined: “Imagine global wealth managers allocate just 1% of their portfolios to bitcoin on average … a 2.5% allocation to bitcoin has enhanced a traditional 60/40 portfolio’s risk-adjusted returns in every three-year period in bitcoin’s history.” Hougan continued: A 1% allocation across the board would mean ~$1 trillion of inflows into the space. Hunter Horsley, cofounder and CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, explained on social media platform X this week why he believes the upcoming bitcoin halving will be the most impactful one so far. “The April 2024 Bitcoin halving may be the most impactful we’ve seen,” he wrote. “Why? The last Bitcoin halving, 2020, bitcoin was at ~$9,000. So the supply reduction in $ terms was ~$9M a day, and ~$3B a year.” The executive noted: This halving with bitcoin ~$70,000, it will be >3x greater in $ terms: ~$32M a day and ~$11B a year. A much larger reduction of natural selling, at the same time as we are seeing rising demand. What do you think about the statements and predictions by Bitwise’s executives?

Bitcoin’s 1-hour chart reveals recent volatility, with a significant bounce from a low of approximately $68,362, suggesting a strong support level. Conversely, the resistance near the recent high of approximately $71,754 poses a point for potential profit-taking or exit, marking a critical decision point for short-term bitcoin traders. On a medium-term basis, the 4-hour BTC/USD chart smoothes out the immediate volatility, presenting a broader view. Notably, a rebound from the support level of $60,760 indicates a strong foundation for bitcoin’s price. The resistance near $71,754 remains a target for realizing gains, offering a balanced perspective for those navigating the 4-hour landscape.   The daily chart underscores a clear uptrend, with bitcoin consistently marking higher lows and higher highs — a bullish signal for long-term traders. The significant support level at $38,505 and a resistance near $73,794 outline the broader market sentiment and trend. BTC’s oscillators present a mixed but predominantly neutral stance. The momentum indicator signals bullish sentiment and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) suggests a bearish sentiment. This divergence calls for cautious interpretation. Moving averages (MAs) across various time frames unanimously indicate a positive outlook, reflecting a strong bullish sentiment underlying bitcoin’s current trajectory. With a trade volume of $31.07 billion and a robust market capitalization of $1.37 trillion, the market sentiment towards BTC is undeniably positive at the moment. The trading volume corroborates the high interest and activity within BTC’s market, suggesting sustained investor engagement and speculation. The comprehensive analysis of bitcoin’s performance on March 29, 2024, illuminates a predominantly bullish horizon. The currency’s ability to maintain an upward trajectory, as evidenced by the unanimous buy signals from moving averages (MAs) and the resilience at key support levels, underpins a strong foundation for further growth. While the optimistic perspective holds merit, a cautious examination reveals underlying concerns that could temper the bullish outlook for bitcoin. The divergence in oscillator readings, particularly the sell signal from the MACD amidst a predominantly buying environment, signals potential overextension in the market. Such mixed indicators suggest that the current bullish momentum may face headwinds, potentially leading to corrections.

He now anticipates the cryptocurrency reaching $100K by September. The famous author also announced his intention to purchase more bitcoin this week, citing the approaching halving event. He encouraged investors to consider adding bitcoin to their portfolios if they haven’t already done so. The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, shared his updated bitcoin price prediction in a lengthy post on social media platform X on Monday. He also encouraged investors to buy bitcoin and announced his own plan to purchase more BTC, citing the upcoming halving event as the key factor in his decision. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries. Kiyosaki wrote: I am buying 10 more bitcoin before April. Why? The ‘Halving.’ If you can’t afford a whole bitcoin you may want to consider buying 1/10 of a coin, via the new ETFs or satoshi’s. I expect bitcoin to be $100K by September 2024. The renowned author also mentioned that if investors are uncomfortable buying bitcoin or spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), they should consider silver as an alternative investment. “If you are not into bitcoin I suggest buying silver coins, preferably U.S. silver eagles.” He emphasized: “My friend Andy Schectman states the once abundant supply of silver is nearly gone.” Schectman is the president and owner of bullion dealer Miles Franklin. While investing in a spot bitcoin ETF is a way to get exposure to the price of BTC, ETF investors do not own actual bitcoin. Kiyosaki proceeded to explain that “smart money” is flocking to BTC “because the ‘smart money’ knows the U.S. is the biggest debtor nation in the world; China’s property market is ‘toast;’ Japan has been in a depression since 1990; Germany is sliding into a depression, mom and pop consumer are living on credit cards; banks are in trouble; and the world is on the brink of war.” The acclaimed author also endorsed the view of Microstrategy’s executive chairman, Michael Saylor, who recently said: “People who use fiat as a store of value, we have a name for them: poor.” Noting that fiat money is “fake money,” Kiyosaki stressed: Michael Saylor, Andy Schectman and me do not want you to be poor. Please start acquiring gold, silver, bitcoin, if you already have not started. “Of the three, silver is the most affordable for most people,” the renowned author said, adding that silver is currently trading around $35 per ounce, compared to bitcoin’s price tag of roughly $70,000 and gold’s price of approximately $2,500 per ounce. “Please don’t be a poor person saving fake money,” Kiyosaki stressed, emphasizing: “Almost everyone in the world can afford at least one silver coin or one bitcoin satoshi. Be smart, take action, and take care.” Kiyosaki has become increasingly vocal about his support for BTC. Last week, he urged investors to buy as much bitcoin as they can afford, praising its limited supply and classifying the crypto alongside gold and silver as “real assets.” Earlier this month, he predicted that BTC will reach $300K this year. Last month, he said bitcoin would reach $100,000 by June, but he has now revised this forecast to September.

The day’s trading ranged from $64,568 to $67,672, indicating a volatile yet upward trend.  A close examination of bitcoin’s (BTC) oscillators suggests a predominantly neutral to bullish sentiment among traders. The relative strength index (RSI) at 55 and the Stochastic at 41, along with other indicators like the commodity channel index (CCI) and the average directional index (ADI), signal a market in equilibrium, awaiting directional cues. However, the awesome oscillator and momentum hint at underlying buying pressure, contrasting with the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) level’s bearish signal, underscoring the market’s complexity and traders’ cautious optimism.   Bitcoin’s moving averages (MAs) paint a diverse picture, primarily skewing towards bullish action with the exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA) across various periods largely indicating positive signals. Notably, the SMA (20)’s bearish signal is an outlier in an otherwise bullish trend across shorter and longer periods, reflecting potential temporary overvaluations but affirming the overall upward trajectory. The 1-hour chart reveals a recent uptrend, suggesting bullish short-term momentum with the price consolidating after a sharp rise. For traders, the strategy involves waiting for a breakout above the recent high or a breakdown below the consolidation. The 4-hour chart amplifies the bullish trend seen in the shorter time frame, with more pronounced pullbacks indicating a volatile but decisively bullish market. The daily chart underscores a clear uptrend with higher volume on up days, signifying strong market participation and confidence in Bitcoin’s value proposition. The strategy for long-term investors involves looking for breaks above key resistance levels, with careful consideration of stop loss placements to mitigate daily volatility’s impact. With Bitcoin’s market capitalization at $1.31 trillion and a trading volume of $29.89 billion, the data points to a vibrant ecosystem underpinned by high liquidity and continued trader engagement. The comprehensive technical analysis of BTC for March 25, 2024, strongly supports a bullish outlook. The convergence of positive signals from moving averages and significant buying momentum, as evidenced by the awesome oscillator and momentum indicators, outlines a robust foundation for continued upward movement. The consistent increase in market capitalization and trading volume further bolsters this perspective, suggesting a healthy and growing interest in bitcoin. Despite the prevailing bullish sentiment, a cautious examination reveals underlying vulnerabilities that could pivot towards a bearish scenario for bitcoin. The sell signal from the MACD level and the SMA (20)’s indication of potential overvaluation present cracks in the otherwise optimistic facade. These signals, amidst a backdrop of broad market neutrality from other oscillators, suggest that the current bullish momentum may be overstretched and susceptible to correction.

He explained that while Skybridge’s clients appreciate having bitcoin in their portfolios, the significant BTC price swings are a concern. “They don’t like the volatility ride,” Scaramucci stressed. “The hardest thing for anyone in this room to do is to do nothing.” Emphasizing that “The dead people at Charles Schwab do far better than the living people,” the Skybridge Capital founder advised: So act like you’re dead with your bitcoin and don’t sell your bitcoin. Don’t do anything with it. Hopefully, we can continue to coach our clients to listen to that mantra. Speaking to Yahoo Finance Live at the conference, Scaramucci reiterated the massive demand for bitcoin fueled by spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “We had a retail explosion in bitcoin demand in the beginning. It’s now flipped over where institutions are comfortable because they have an ETF that they can purchase and greenlighted by the SEC. And you have the halving coming up,” he opined. Scaramucci added: And if you have this pace of demand, that should push the price up a lot. Despite bitcoin shattering its previous record highs, Scaramucci believes BTC is still a good buy. Earlier this month, he stressed that it is still “very early” to buy the crypto, emphasizing that he sees bitcoin as the new Berkshire Hathaway. After predicting a surge of Wall Street money into spot bitcoin ETFs, he wrote on X: “The flows to bitcoin are going to accelerate.” In February, he predicted that a “face-ripply rally” is incoming for BTC. Scaramucci sees bitcoin as a multi-trillion-dollar asset class. He said in September last year that the next 10 to 20 years are “remarkably bullish” for bitcoin.

JPMorgan’s analysts expect continued selling pressure on bitcoin as the halving approaches, “particularly against a positioning backdrop that still looks overbought despite the past week’s correction.” JPMorgan’s analysts, led by global strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, warned in a Thursday note that bitcoin remains in “overbought territory” despite the cryptocurrency’s recent price decline. This suggests that the price of BTC could fall further. By examining two metrics, JPMorgan’s futures position proxies and the price premium of bitcoin futures compared to the spot price, the analysts explained: Both metrics indicate that bitcoin remains in overbought territory despite the sharp correction over the past week. JPMorgan further warned that the recent slowdowns in spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows cast doubt on the market’s optimistic prediction of year-end price hikes. While hopes were high for sustained demand fueled by bitcoin ETFs and the upcoming Bitcoin halving, these new figures suggest the flow of funds into spot ETFs might not be as continuous as some anticipated. After weeks of inflows, 10 spot bitcoin ETFs that began trading in early January saw money flow out last week as Grayscale’s bitcoin trust (GBTC) continued to see significant outflows. Meanwhile, nine spot bitcoin ETFs, excluding Grayscale’s GBTC, accumulated  $1.3 billion in BTC in six days. Regarding the future price of bitcoin, the JPMorgan analysts added: As we approach the halving event, this profit-taking is more likely to continue, particularly against a positioning backdrop that still looks overbought despite the past week’s correction. Last month, JPMorgan issued a bearish warning, predicting a drop in bitcoin’s price to $42,000 after the April halving. The bank also downplayed the impact of the halving and upcoming Ethereum upgrade, suggesting the market has already factored these events in. Earlier this month, Panigirtzoglou said: “It would be unrealistic to expect bitcoin to match gold within investors’ portfolios in notional amounts.” Meanwhile, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon remains a crypto skeptic, declaring this month: “I won’t personally ever buy a bitcoin.” What do you think about JPMorgan’s warnings?

Anticipating bitcoin going to “zero,” he stressed: “I’m very skeptical of crypto. I don’t expect it to last … I do not see any long-term value in cryptocurrency.” Despite bitcoin’s recent price explosion that set a new all-time high, veteran investor Jim Rogers remains skeptical of the cryptocurrency and the broader crypto market. Rogers is George Soros’ former business partner who co-founded the Quantum Fund and Soros Fund Management. Rogers threw cold water on the crypto craze at the India Today conclave last week, stating: I’m very skeptical of crypto. I don’t expect it to last. It’s been fabulous for some people now. Not for me, but I do not see any long-term value in cryptocurrency. “I have more confidence in the future in real things that people can use than I do in bitcoin,” he continued. “Whether it’s rice or sugar doesn’t matter. I know that rice will always have value. It has always. I do not know that bitcoin will always have value.” The veteran investor also asserted: Bitcoin will disappear and go to zero someday. On the other hand, he pointed out that the value of commodities such as sugar will not vanish. “The value of sugar is not going to disappear and go to zero someday,” he noted. Moreover, Rogers doubts bitcoin’s ability to replace safe-haven assets like gold and silver. “I don’t think that bitcoin is going to replace gold and I don’t think it’s going to replace silver,” he opined. “Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe I should sell all of my gold and silver and buy bitcoin. But as far as I can see, most people in the world understand gold and silver, but most do not understand bitcoin.” Rogers also confirmed that he does not own bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies. When asked where he would buy gold or bitcoin, he replied: “I have never bought bitcoin. I have never sold or short bitcoin. I do have a lot of gold and silver as you can see.” He concluded: In my view, cryptocurrencies apparently are good trading vehicles … I expect them all to disappear someday. Many of them have already disappeared. The renowned investor has long been a crypto skeptic. In 2021, he said he wouldn’t buy bitcoin because governments may outlaw cryptocurrencies. He followed this up in 2022 by highlighting government desires to control and regulate all aspects of crypto. In February this year, he cast further doubt on bitcoin’s potential to become money. Rogers’ skepticism extends beyond cryptocurrencies. He has also warned of the potential demise of the U.S. dollar, pointing to countries exploring alternative reserve currencies. He predicted that the U.S. will suffer as the value of the dollar erodes further, seeing the Chinese yuan as the USD’s competitor.

Amidst a backdrop of neutral oscillators and a mixed sentiment in moving averages, bitcoin traders are navigating through a volatile environment.  Oscillators, quintessential for identifying market momentum and potential reversal points, present a predominantly neutral stance on BTC’s current state. The relative strength index (RSI) stands at 51, hovering around the midline, suggesting a balance between buyers and sellers. Other key oscillators like the Stochastic and the commodity channel index (CCI) fortify this neutrality, signaling a period of indecision. However, the momentum oscillator’s dip into the buy zone hints at an underlying bullish sentiment, contrasted by a bearish moving average convergence divergence (MACD) level.   The narrative from moving averages (MAs) paints a contrasting picture, bifurcated by short-term bearishness and a more optimistic long-term outlook. Short-term indicators, such as the 10 and 20-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) and simple moving averages (SMAs), indicate bearish sentiment, reflecting recent price declines. Conversely, the long-term perspective, illuminated by the 30 to 200-day EMAs and SMAs, overwhelmingly suggests positive sentiment, indicative of underlying strength and potential for upward movement. The 1-hour chart reveals immediate market sentiment with a series of bearish drops indicating a short-term downtrend. This recent price action from approximately $67,937 to $64,537, accompanied by stable yet occasionally spiking volumes, underscores the presence of selling pressure, hinting at cautious trader behavior. Expanding the view to the 4-hour chart introduces a tale of volatility, with price movements narrating a story of recovery post a significant sell-off. The alternation between ups and downs from around $68,902 to $60,760, and then a partial recovery, showcases the market’s resilience and the tug-of-war between bulls and bears. The daily chart, offering the broadest lens, depicts an overarching uptrend from $50,519 to a peak of $73,974 before transitioning into a consolidation phase. This macro perspective highlights the mixed trading activity, with significant volumes marking both advances and declines, suggesting a vibrant market responding to various stimuli. Despite the short-term bearish signals and a landscape of market neutrality, the long-term indicators fortify a bullish stance for bitcoin. The compelling buy signals from the extended moving averages, coupled with the underlying momentum hinted by specific oscillators, sketch a promising picture of resilience and potential growth. The overarching uptrend visible in the daily chart, supported by strong foundational buying interest at lower levels, suggests that the current consolidation phase may well be a springboard for future rallies. While the long-term outlook holds a shimmer of optimism, the immediate technical indicators caution against potential turbulence. The prevailing short-term sell signals, mirrored in both the MAs and the oscillators’ neutrality, paint a picture of immediate uncertainty and risk. The recent downtrends observed in the shorter time frames, such as the 1-hour and 4-hour charts, underscore a prevailing selling pressure that cannot be overlooked.

However, the issue Schiff pinpointed isn’t unique to bitcoin ETFs. This discussion has reignited calls for self-custody among crypto proponents. Gold advocate and economist Peter Schiff has highlighted a problem with owning spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He wrote on social media platform X Tuesday: One problem with owning bitcoin in an ETF is that liquidity is limited to U.S. market hours. So if the market crashes overnight, you have no ability to sell until the U.S. market opens for trading in the morning. Very frustrating to watch helplessly with no ability to get out. Schiff’s statement came after the price of bitcoin dipped earlier this week. The gold bug shared on X Monday: “The more bitcoin that moves into ETFs, the more vulnerable bitcoin becomes to a catastrophic crash. That’s because ETF buyers are more likely traders than true believers. So if bitcoin is going up they’ll go along for the ride. But once it enters a bear market, they’ll bail out.” When the liquidity of physical gold is questioned, Schiff replied: “Gold doesn’t crash overnight like bitcoin. So there is nothing to worry about.” Many people commented on Schiff’s post. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed out that the issue Schiff raised with spot bitcoin ETFs applies to other ETFs as well, including gold ETFs. The analyst detailed on X: This isn’t new though or exclusive to bitcoin. Gold ETFs? Same thing. Any commodity ETF. Yup. International equity ETFs. Same deal. Even stocks that have market moving events occurring after market hours or during the weekend is pretty similar. A number of bitcoin proponents responded to Schiff’s post by emphasizing the importance of self-custody and buying BTC directly instead of through ETFs. Simon Dixon, CEO and co-founder of Bank To The Future, replied to Schiff: “True. Plus no ability to buy bitcoin ETF when the market is closed. Moral of the story is to own real bitcoin if you can. It’s a lot easier than owning real gold without a custodian.” Entrepreneur Bryce Clark opined: You know Peter Schiff brings up a good point here, you really should self custody your crypto, stop letting third parties hold it. Great advice and thanks for the warning Peter. Dave Weisberger, an advocate of digital assets for economic freedom, wrote: “Unwittingly, Peter provides another reason why the world’s analog asset markets WILL go digital… 24/7, multi-currency markets, with on-demand settlement, using on-chain value stores as the unit of account ARE superior & will be adopted.” What do you think about Peter Schiff’s warning regarding spot bitcoin ETFs?

The price movements of bitcoin persist in the lead-up to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s gathering on Wednesday afternoon.  On March 20, 2024, bitcoin’s (BTC) 1-hour chart reveals a prevailing downtrend, characterized by a sequence of lower highs and lows, pointing towards a short-term bearish sentiment among traders. This downtrend is accompanied by consistent volume, suggesting a steady selling pressure without sharp increases, signaling cautiousness among traders. Expanding our lens to the 4-hour chart, the continuation of the downtrend becomes evident, underscored by a significant drop in value on March 19, indicative of strong selling pressure.   Although there have been minor rebounds, the lack of substantial volume casts doubt on the sustainability of these upward movements. The daily chart offers a macroscopic view of bitcoin’s trajectory, further emphasizing the bearish trend with a succession of declining prices. Yet, the latest rebound’s appearance might signal a reversal’s onset. Turning to the oscillators and moving averages (MAs), a mixed signal landscape emerges. Oscillators like the relative strength index (RSI) and Stochastic linger in neutral territory, suggesting a balanced force between buyers and sellers. Yet, the momentum oscillator tilts towards a bullish signal, adding a layer of complexity to the decision-making process. Conversely, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) level advocates for bearish sentiment reflecting the nuanced interplay of market forces. The MAs paint a broader picture of sentiment over time, with shorter-term averages (EMA and SMA for 10 and 20 days) signaling negative undertones, reflecting recent price dips. However, longer-term averages gradually shift to a positive stance, highlighting underlying strength and potential for appreciation over an extended horizon. Amid the intricate dance of indicators and chart patterns, the underlying bullish signals embedded within the longer-term moving averages cannot be ignored. These averages, reflective of a steadfast bitcoin accumulation phase, signal a potential upward trajectory as the market sentiment gradually shifts. Coupled with the recent upswing on the daily chart hinting at a reversal, and the momentum oscillator’s bullish inclination, there’s a palpable sense of optimism. However, the prevailing short-term downtrend and the chorus of bearish signals from the immediate moving averages and the MACD level cast a shadow of caution. The persistent selling pressure, underscored by the bearish patterns on the 1-hour and 4-hour charts, suggests that the market is not yet ready to reverse its course. The absence of a significant volume surge accompanying the potential reversal signs indicates a lack of conviction among buyers, potentially leading to a continuation of the bearish trend.

Pointing to his “top signals,” he cautioned that the market could “cool off massively for a few months before hopefully ramping up again in the fall.”  Scott Melker, also known as the “Wolf of All Streets,” shared his concerns regarding the current bitcoin market in a post on social media platform X on Monday. Melker is a well-known trader, investor, writer, and host of the Wolf of All Streets podcast. In 2020, he won the Binance Influencer of the Year Award for North America. “I have some concerns,” he began. “Fundamentally, with the [spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund] ETF interest and the cycle ramping up, I want to believe that we go much, much higher.” However, he stressed: “Most of the top signals I would normally look for when I am not FOMOing are present — meme coins going insane, huge run on alts to historically overbought, bearish divergences showing across the board on high times frames, and max greed.” The Wolf of All Street cautioned: I would not be AT ALL surprised to see this market cool off massively for a few months before hopefully ramping up again in the fall. Melker emphasized that he is not making a prediction, clarifying that he’s simply “observing that we are at one of those phases where NOBODY is paying attention to any historic top signals.” The Wolf of All Streets host recently shared his bitcoin market outlook on multiple occasions. In February, he suggested that bitcoin halving might propel BTC’s price to $240K. Earlier this month, he remarked on the beginning of a significant bull run for bitcoin and the broader crypto market, though he cautioned about an impending “huge bubble.” He also anticipated a resurgence of mainstream crypto fear of missing out (FOMO) once meme crypto dogecoin (DOGE) reaches a new all-time high.

This downturn led to the liquidation of a substantial number of bitcoin long positions, with more than $180 million being liquidated since yesterday. After hitting its peak at $73,794, bitcoin (BTC) has declined by 14% to stand at $63,000 as of 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on Tuesday. Over the previous 24 hours, BTC saw a decrease of 7%, reaching a high of $68,526 and dipping to a low of $62,355 by 7:27 a.m. (ET). Currently, bitcoin’s market cap is at $1.23 trillion, with the cryptocurrency seeing $66.22 billion in trading volume over the last day.  The top trading pairs for BTC include FDUSD, USDT, USD, and USDC, with the South Korean won emerging as the fifth largest pairing on Tuesday. The won accounts for 1.92% of all bitcoin exchanges, while the USD makes up 12.94%. Although the global weighted average hovers just over $63,000, in South Korea, BTC’s price remains high at $70,490 per unit. The fall in BTC’s value has also impacted the broader cryptocurrency market, which saw an overall decrease of 8.19% since yesterday. “Although the pullback is large in dollar terms, it is perfectly normal to see drawdowns of this percentage,” Etoro’s market analyst Simon Peters told Bitcoin.com News on Tuesday. “Historically we have seen drawdowns or pullbacks as high as 30% during bitcoin bull markets. The question now is whether the price has pulled back far enough for investors to buy the dip, or whether the price action could extend its decline.” Peters continued: Attention now turns to this week’s FOMC meeting, in particular the press conference with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powel on Wednesday, which could influence the direction of crypto markets in the short term. Besides the eagerly awaited Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is also concluding its negative interest rate policy, a stance held since 2016. The BOJ is setting a new short-term rate target in the 0-0.1% bracket and applying a 0.1% interest to reserves, alongside moving away from its bond yield control strategy. The impact of these macroeconomic developments on bitcoin and the broader crypto market is yet to unfold.

The bank also adjusted its ether forecast as it anticipates the approval of a spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May. Standard Chartered has revised its bitcoin price forecast for this year and the next. The bank’s revision aligns with the record trading volumes and notable inflows witnessed in spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in recent weeks. Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s head of crypto research, explained that the bank determined its BTC price targets by analyzing bitcoin’s performance in relation to the price of gold following the introduction of gold ETFs in the U.S., and by correlating ETF inflows and the price of BTC. “We think the gold analogy — in terms of both ETF impact and the optimal portfolio mix — remains a good starting point for estimating the ‘correct’ BTC price level medium-term,” Kendrick wrote in a note Monday, adding: If ETF inflows reach our mid-point estimate of $75 billion, and/or if reserve managers buy BTC, we see a good chance of an overshoot to the $250,000 level at some stage in 2025. The analyst anticipates bitcoin’s price stabilizing at approximately $200,000 in 2025. Standard Chartered similarly said in January that BTC could hit $200K in 2025 with spot bitcoin ETF approval. In April last year, Standard Chartered said crypto winter had ended. In November, the bank noted that “crypto spring has sprung,” emphasizing that BTC could reach $100K sooner than previously predicted. For this year, Kendrick now anticipates bitcoin reaching $150,000, as the sharper-than-expected gains observed so far this year have boosted his previous estimate of $100,000. He believes that the new spot bitcoin ETFs would introduce BTC to a new group of investors, emphasizing that net inflows have become bitcoin’s largest driver and are likely to be sticky. Also boosting his price forecast is the bitcoin halving event in April. Standard Chartered continues to anticipate the approval of a spot ether ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May. In January, Kendrick predicted that ether’s price would climb to $4,000 by the anticipated approval date. The analyst has turned more bullish on Ethereum since his previous prediction. In a note on Monday, Kendrick projected even greater potential upside for ETH, expecting an SEC approval of an ether ETF to result in inflows of up to $45 billion within the first 12 months, driving ETH’s price to $8,000 by the end of 2024. He also anticipates that Ethereum’s latest upgrade will significantly reduce transaction costs and further boost the price of ETH. The Standard Chartered head of crypto research described: Given our estimated BTC price level of USD 200,000 at end-2025, that would imply an ETH price of $14,000.

The executive anticipates continued significant inflows into U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as endowments and family offices increase bitcoin exposure in their investment portfolios. Binance CEO Richard Teng shared his bitcoin outlook and price forecast at an event in Bangkok on Sunday. Teng took over as the chief executive of Binance after Changpeng Zhao (CZ) stepped down in November last year following the crypto exchange’s $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities. Teng explained that U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen significant inflows since their approval in January, adding that he expects more endowments and family offices to increase allocations to these funds in the near future. Referencing his earlier forecast of bitcoin reaching $80,000 by the end of the year, Teng explained that he now sees the crypto’s price exceeding his estimate “with supply reducing and demand continuing to come through.” While clarifying that the BTC price forecast was his personal view, he described that the crypto rally won’t be a “straight line,” stating that the ups and downs will be good for the market. Teng also commented on bitcoin’s recent achievement of a new all-time high and the significant inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs, stating: “We’re just getting started.” Many people expect a substantial surge in bitcoin’s price, fueled by demand for spot bitcoin ETFs and the halving. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz anticipates BTC hitting $100K this year, citing “runaway momentum” for spot bitcoin ETFs. Bernstein’s analysts are now more convinced that the crypto will reach $150K by mid-2025. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said BTC could top $200K this year due to “too much demand and not enough supply.” Meanwhile, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki expects BTC to hit $300K this year.

The analyst Plan B continues to shed light on his well-known stock-to-flow (S2F) model, which suggests that “exponential growth” is expected to “continue.” The crypto community is still buzzing with excitement, and Plan B, the architect behind the BTC price prediction model known as S2F, is increasingly sharing his S2F charts and insights. “Bitcoin realized price (cost base) is rising, but still very slowly (5-10% per month: green),” Plan B remarked on Sunday. He added, “Current market is comparable with mid-2012, begin-2017, Oct-2020 (green). Interesting times ahead.” Despite criticisms from bitcoin investors like Fred Krueger, who argues that the S2F model “is completely wrong, and must be killed,” Plan B has remained steadfast in sharing his S2F perspectives. Krueger, on the other hand, supports a Power Law model, which also anticipates a substantial rise in BTC’s price. Plan B, undeterred, unveiled another S2F chart on Monday, noting: Stock-to-Flow 2020-2024 halving cycle: ~$50K, Stock-to-Flow 2024-2028 halving cycle: ~$500K, Stock-to-Flow 2028-2032 halving cycle: ~$5M, Yes, S2F = exponential growth, and it will continue IMO. A community member reacted to Plan B’s post, expressing, “I’d be happy if this happens. But 3-4 data points can only predict the general direction, NOT the price like $500K average in 2024-28. Caution is advised to all.” Plan B responded, acknowledging, “Very true. Only 3 halvings (2012, 2016 and 2020) plus the crucial pre-halving period (where BTC S2F grew from below 1 to ~4). And S2F is only for general direction, of course, and with wide error margin (for example: prediction 2020-2024 was 55K but in reality ~33K).” To date, BTC has managed to reach a peak of $73,794 per unit, and since then, it has stabilized well below that figure, trading around the $66,500 to $67,150 range at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Monday. Former managing director at Barclays and the current chief investment officer at crypto lender Ledn, John Glover, believes we’re due a significant dip before the next leg up, which could be as high as $92K during the current bull run. “My view that the [bitcoin] price will have a correction seems to have struck a nerve with some readers,” Glover said in a note sent to Bitcoin.com News. “It’s important to note that while I am a believer that no price moves in a straight line, I do continue to look for $85-92K before this latest bull trend completes,” Glover added: Retail players are just starting to come into the [bitcoin] ETF’s en masse and the next big entry is set to coincide with the halving, so things should get interesting in a month or so.

Presently, bitcoin’s (BTC) oscillators present a mixed view but lean toward a cautious sentiment. The relative strength index (RSI) hovers at 60, suggesting a neutral stance yet inching closer to overbought territory. Both the Stochastic and the commodity channel index (CCI) echo this neutrality, indicating a lack of immediate directional momentum. However, signals of concern emerge from the momentum oscillator and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) levels, hinting at underlying selling pressures with their respective bearish signals. In contrast to the oscillators, the moving averages (MAs) sing a bullish hymn. From the short to the long term, the exponential (EMAs) and simple moving averages (SMAs) progressively tilt towards bullish signals, especially notable in the longer spans (50, 100, and 200 periods). This gradient of optimism underscores a strengthening foundational support for bitcoin’s price, despite recent market volatilities. Particularly, the bullish signals from both the 200-day SMA and EMA highlight a strong long-term bullish outlook, suggesting that any dips may be perceived as buying opportunities by savvy traders.   The 1-hour chart reveals a relatively stable yet cautiously optimistic view. Sideways movement dominates, punctuated by a slight bullish inclination. The support level at approximately $64,522 offers a floor from which rebounds have occurred, while the short-term resistance at $68,902 caps upward aspirations. The absence of significant volume spikes suggests a market in wait-and-see mode, potentially awaiting catalysts for a decisive move. Expanding our lens to the 4-hour chart, we encounter a landscape marked by greater volatility. Recent downward trends, as evidenced by large dips and increased selling pressure, bring attention to the strong support line at approximately $64,000. Conversely, a lofty resistance level of $73,794 stands as a testament to the hurdles bitcoin faces on its path upwards. The daily chart perspective offers a narrative of an uptrend losing momentum, now transitioning into a consolidation phase. Long-term support far below the current trading range at $49,267, coupled with the consistent resistance at $73,794, frames the battlefield for BTC’s next major move. The diminishing volume on downtrends subtly hints at a weakening selling pressure, potentially paving the way for bullish undertakings. The analysis of bitcoin’s current market positioning, supported by the overwhelmingly positive signals from the long-term moving averages and the stabilizing price action, strongly leans toward a bullish prognosis. The resilience displayed at key support levels across various time frames, coupled with a gradual build-up in buying sentiment as indicated by moving averages, suggests that BTC is well-poised for an upward trajectory. The neutral stance of oscillators, rather than signaling immediate exuberance, provides room for growth before reaching overbought conditions, thereby offering a solid foundation for potential gains. Conversely, the bear verdict emerges from a critical examination of BTC’s short-term oscillators and the recent volatility captured in the 4-hour chart analysis. The signals of selling pressure, as evidenced by the bearish actions in the momentum and MACD levels, alongside the significant resistance awaiting at higher price points, cast a shadow of caution over the immediate future of bitcoin’s price action. The mixed signals from oscillators, suggesting a market teetering on the edge of overbought territory, coupled with the potential for increased selling pressure at key resistance levels, advocate for a cautious approach.

Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz discussed the possibility of a significant bitcoin price correction, similar to past market cycles, in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. Novogratz explained that as long as there’s a net inflow into nine U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the price of BTC “is going to keep grinding higher.” He added that once we have a net outflow from the nine spot bitcoin ETFs, “you’ll see the first real correction, and so I think, right now, every trader is watching” spot bitcoin ETF inflows. “Of course, there’s lots of other inflows and outflows in the bitcoin universe but right now that’s got the Zeitgeist of what people are making their trading decisions off of.” While emphasizing that “Things are frothy, funding rates are high, and so in times like this, you always have to be ready for a correction,” Novogratz opined: I don’t think we go back below $50,000 – $55,000. I think that’s the new floor unless something dramatic happens. The nine spot bitcoin ETFs which traders are watching are Blackrock’s Ishares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), Ark 21shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO), Wisdomtree Bitcoin ETF (BTCW), Vaneck Bitcoin Trust ETF (HODL), Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC),and Valkyrie Bitcoin ETF (BRRR). Last week, the Galaxy Digital CEO said that he expects BTC to reach $100K this year, citing “runaway momentum” in spot bitcoin ETFs. “We have for the first time ever, anyone who wanted to buy bitcoin can buy it. We’re kind of in price discovery, and with price discovery, it’s hard to see where things will go.” The executive also noted: “Right now there are more buyers and sellers.” Novogratz further shared on Wednesday: This has been a wild ride of an asset. We’re in price discovery mode right now, and if you’re looking at the charts, you could see $100,000 … that could be a target. Do you think bitcoin will fall below $55,000 again?

Despite this turbulence, its market capitalization still holds strong at just over $1.3 trillion, supported by a substantial 24-hour trading volume of $89 billion. The analysis of bitcoin’s (BTC) oscillators and moving averages (MAs) presents a mixed signal for BTC’s immediate direction. Oscillators such as the relative strength index (59) and the Stochastic (78) indicate a neutral stance, suggesting a period of consolidation. However, the momentum indicator points to a bullish action, contrasted by the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) level advocating a bearish stance, illustrating the market’s current indecisiveness.   On the MA front, the predominance of buy signals across various timeframes, especially the longer-term exponential moving average (EMA 200) and simple moving average (SMA 200), signifies underlying strength and potential for upward momentum. The daily chart depicts a significant uptrend interrupted by a recent bearish drop, breaching previous support levels. This development might signal a correction phase or a potential reversal, with the recent high at $73,794 per BTC now serving as a formidable resistance level. A closer examination of the 4-hour and hourly charts reveals a more detailed narrative of the sell-off, characterized by several bearish drops and increased volume on downward movements, indicating strong selling pressure. This granular view suggests a cautious approach, advising bitcoin traders to seek confirmation of trend reversal or stabilization before engaging. In alignment with the observed technical indicators, potential entry points should be predicated on bullish reversal patterns, particularly after touching the support level at $65,569. Despite the recent volatility and sell-off pressures, bitcoin’s foundational technical indicators, particularly the strong buy signals from the majority of MAs, suggest a resilient underlying strength. The market’s capacity to sustain above critical support levels, coupled with the optimistic signals from long-term MAs, paints a favorable scenario for recovery and potential upward momentum. On the flip side, the recent bearish slide breaking past support levels on the daily chart, combined with increased volume on down moves, signals a potential shift in market dynamics towards a bearish trend. The mixed signals from oscillators, particularly the sell action indicated by the MACD level, along with the immediate pressure observed in the 4-hourly and hourly charts, suggest that the path of least resistance may be downward.

Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra shared their optimistic bitcoin outlook in a note published earlier this week. The analysts explained that they are “now more convinced” about a BTC price breakout post-April halving event. While noting that “These are still early days of bitcoin’s integration into traditional asset portfolios,” they wrote: We are now more convinced about our $150K price for bitcoin. The Bernstein analysts predicted in November last year that the price of bitcoin could rise to $150K by 2025. Their confidence in BTC achieving that price target has been reinforced by the increasing inflows into spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “At this run rate, bitcoin ETFs would surpass our 2025 inflow estimates within 166 trading days for [the] rest of 2024,” the analysts detailed. “We built bitcoin institutional flows in our estimates to arrive at bitcoin price. We estimated $10 billion inflows for 2024 and another $60 billion for 2025.” The analysts highlighted the recent decline in bitcoin miners’ stocks as possibly the “final opportunity” for investors before the halving event. They suggested that shares of mining companies could rapidly recover to align with bitcoin’s price surge. “We believe bitcoin miners are still largely retail-traded stocks and institutions have largely stayed away from bitcoin proxies, as traditional investors remain skeptical and still approach crypto with a rear-view bias,” they advised, noting: We expect institutional interest in bitcoin equities to finally tip over, and bitcoin miners to be the largest beneficiaries. The bitcoin miners trade requires some more patience. Many people believe that the high demand for spot bitcoin ETFs will increase the price of bitcoin. Scott Melker, aka the Wold of All Streets, said last week that he sees the start of a major bull run for bitcoin and the broader crypto market.

Meanwhile, the crypto community is abuzz with debates on whether the impending halving event is already reflected in the price. There’s a prevailing suspicion that despite bitcoin’s climb against the U.S. dollar, the anticipated increase from the halving has yet to be incorporated into the value of the cryptocurrency and might occur after the fourth epoch. The fourth Bitcoin halving is on the horizon, with data indicating the significant event is less than five weeks away, or shy of 5,300 blocks. Traditionally, the halving garners considerable attention, especially from miners, as their rewards will be cut from 6.25 bitcoins per block to 3.125 bitcoins post-halving. Like the previous two halvings, there’s widespread expectation that BTC’s price will ascend following the epoch. Several crypto advocates anticipate a supply shock for bitcoin in the near future. “[Bitcoin] continues to be taken off exchanges,” the X account Lark Davis wrote on Thursday. “The demand for coins has ramped up significantly. New issuance is about to be cut in two at the halving next month. This raise[s] the very real possibility of an incoming supply shock.” $100k before the halving… pic.twitter.com/OS9mE9UJYt — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) March 8, 2024 In tandem with discussions on the impending supply shock, there’s also buzz about whether the halving has already been factored into the market price. BTC has experienced a significant increase in value approaching the fourth halving, leading to speculation that this rise may already be accounted for. Moreover, there’s conjecture that BTC’s price might decline following the halving. In early March, analysts at JPMorgan forecasted a potential drop in BTC’s price to $42,000 per unit post-halving. Yet, bitcoin advocates hold a much more optimistic view. Historically, BTC’s patterns have demonstrated that in three out of the past three occurrences, its value in U.S. dollars experienced an uptick following the event. This hypothesis, grounded in previous trends, is widely discussed across social media platforms and forums. Additionally, a video by an individual known as ‘Rekt Capital’ is circulating, illustrating how the halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020 led to significant upward trends in the market. On March 11, the enigmatic developer behind the stock-to-flow (S2F) pricing model, Plan B, distributed an image illustrating these past three occurrences and said: First 3 halvings were not priced in… An additional video is also making rounds on the social media platform X, arguing that the halving effect is “never” priced in. Whether BTC will echo its historical performance is an entirely different narrative compared to the projections made by enthusiasts grounded in past assumptions. The potential for a macroeconomic event to trigger a decline in BTC’s price exists, alongside optimistic scenarios such as potential interest rate reductions and quantitative easing (QE). Ultimately, the reality is that observers will simply need to wait and observe the developments in the BTC markets post-halving.

Bitcoin had tapped an all-time price high during the early morning trading sessions on Thursday by briefly tapping $73,794.  Bitcoin’s valuation experienced a fluctuating day on Thursday, initially dipping below the $70,000 mark at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time before ascending back above the $70,000 threshold shortly thereafter. In the early hours of Thursday, bitcoin (BTC) reached a new zenith in its price, touching $73,794 momentarily during morning trading sessions.   By 2:20 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on March 14, 2024, BTC was navigating around $70,271 to $70,905 per unit within a 30-minute span. Earlier in the day, around 3:00 a.m. ET, the leading cryptocurrency had soared to an unprecedented high of $73,794. At its current rate, bitcoin boasts a total market capitalization of approximately $1.40 trillion, having declined by 2.5% in value against the U.S. dollar. A sharp decline observed mid-afternoon brought bitcoin’s value quickly down to a low of $69,882 per unit. This downturn led to the erasure of $51.58 million in bitcoin long positions during a 4-hour stretch. Over the 24-hour period, $88.09 million in BTC long positions were liquidated, as reported by coinglass.com. The BTC/USD hourly chart illustrates a clear downward trend with successive bearish movements. As of now, bitcoin’s 24-hour trading volume stands at about $52.46 billion, contributing to the $173.17 billion transacted across the entire cryptocurrency economy. The primary trading pairs for bitcoin on Thursday are FDUSD, USDT, USD, USDC, and KRW, in that order. The U.S. dollar represents 16.19% of all bitcoin swaps, while the Korean won accounts for 3.35% of bitcoin trading activities on Mar. 14, 2024. The euro makes up 1.17% of all bitcoin trades for the day. Binance and Coinbase emerged as the leading exchanges on Thursday, processing the highest volume of BTC trades. Despite Thursday’s downturn, bitcoin has seen a growth of 5.5% over the week, 14.1% over a two-week span, and 46.3% against the U.S. dollar over the past month. Bitcoin’s dominance in the total market capitalization of $2.69 trillion is approximately 51.5%.

In the past 24 hours, bitcoin not only increased by 1.8% but also showed notable gains over the week (10.7%) and the last two weeks (23.3%), elevating its market cap to an impressive $1.43 trillion. Bitcoin’s (BTC) 1-hour chart analysis uncovers a volatility pattern, swiftly rebounding from a significant price decline on Tuesday. This movement indicates a robust support level of around $68,636. The trend remains upward, as evidenced by the formation of higher lows and higher highs, hinting at the ongoing uptrend’s persistence despite slight consolidations. On the 4-hour chart, bitcoin’s upward trend is more distinctly visible, with crucial support established at $66,264, a level where notable buying activity is detected. The 4-hour chart exhibits a sequence of rapid ascents, showcasing BTC’s consistent bullish momentum. The daily chart provides a more comprehensive view, affirming bitcoin’s strong upward trajectory. Since hitting the last major support near $45,252, bitcoin has been consistently achieving higher highs and higher lows. The existing resistance at $73,679 might be a temporary barrier, with potential entry points emerging upon retesting breakout levels or moving averages.   Strategic exit plans could focus on observing signs of trend reversals or aiming for psychological resistance levels, like the $75,000 milestone. Overall, oscillators such as the relative strength index (RSI), Stochastic, commodity channel index (CCI), and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) mainly signal positive momentum, with a few neutral stances indicating a balanced market sentiment. The consensus across moving averages (MAs) is decisively bullish, ranging from short-term (10-day) to long-term (200-day) analyses, all supporting a bullish outlook. Integrating the analyses from the 1-hour, 4-hour, and daily charts with oscillators and MAs presents a clear depiction of bitcoin’s market stance. It illustrates a landscape filled with bullish sentiment, backed by strong trading volume and market capitalization, eloquently narrating bitcoin’s potential path forward. The analysis of bitcoin’s current market dynamics, oscillators, and moving averages collectively points to a bullish outlook for the foreseeable future. The market’s sentiment is overwhelmingly positive with bitcoin setting new all-time highs and demonstrating robust gains over various time frames. The technical indicators, especially the unanimous bullish signals from both short-term and long-term moving averages, alongside positive signals from key oscillators, reinforce the strength of the ongoing trend. Despite the current bullish sentiment surrounding bitcoin, a cautious approach is warranted for a potential bearish reversal in the medium to long term. The extremely bullish sentiment, as evidenced by the high RSI and the stretched positions in other oscillators, could signal overbought conditions, raising the possibility of a corrective pullback. Furthermore, the significant price gains in a short period might prompt profit-taking actions, potentially leading to increased selling pressure.

The day unfurled with bitcoin dancing between $67,785 and $71,837, revealing a bullish sentiment amidst traders. This swing is underpinned by a robust market capitalization of $1.4 trillion, with a notable 24-hour trading volume of $48.50 billion. Our journey through bitcoin’s (BTC) oscillators reveals a mixed bag of neutral and bullish signals, with the relative strength index (RSI) brushing close to overbought territory at 79. Yet, it’s the moving averages (MAs) that paint a clearer picture of bullish conviction. Across various time frames, from the short 10-day to the long 200-day averages, every sign points toward positive sentiment. This alignment signals a strong undercurrent of buyer enthusiasm, likely fueling the upward trajectory.   A closer examination of the 1-hour chart illustrates a volatile yet upward march, indicating significant buying pressure despite minor sell-offs. Transitioning to the 4-hour chart, we observe a consolidation phase that predicates a bullish outbreak, suggesting a maturing market ready to embrace higher valuations. The daily chart further cements this outlook, with a steady climb over the past month signaling strong buyer interest and a scant presence of sellers. While the bullish signals are strong, the savvy investor should tread with caution. The market’s volatility is not to be underestimated, and while buying pressure is evident, external factors could swiftly alter the landscape. Entry points should be strategized with an eye on retracements, and the overarching bullish sentiment should be navigated with informed precision. A floor of $67,800 has emerged as the initial resistance level for bears, while the pivotal $71,800 mark stands as the primary hurdle that bulls aim to surpass. The convergence of key technical indicators, robust trading volume, and a bullish trend in moving averages on March 11, 2024, underscores a strong upward momentum for bitcoin. With market dynamics favoring buyers, bitcoin is positioned for potential gains, inviting traders to leverage this bullish wave with strategic entries. Despite current bullish signals, underlying market volatility and the near-overbought conditions signal caution. Traders should be wary of potential reversals as external factors and market sentiment shifts could quickly turn the tide, suggesting a bearish scenario might unfold.

Various well-known individuals in the crypto space have made bullish predictions about the price of bitcoin.

To estimate how much bitcoin registered investment advisors (RIAs) might allocate, the strategist compared the crypto to gold, stating: “The most similar asset to compare is gold given the perception of bitcoin as digital version of gold.” Considering the vast $235 trillion traditional and alternative asset class (excluding bank and FX reserve holdings), the JPMorgan strategist detailed that the amount of gold held for investment purposes is around $3.3 trillion, implying an allocation to gold of around 1.4%. “Interestingly, only 7% of this gold, or $230 billion, is held through funds (primarily physical gold ETFs [exchange-traded funds]). The remaining portion is held in bars and coins,” Panigirtzoglou noted, pointing out: One could argue that if bitcoin matches gold in investors’ portfolios, its market cap should rise to $3.3 trillion from $1.3 trillion currently, implying more than doubling in price. However, this calculation misses an important factor which is risk. “Most investors take risk and volatility into account when they allocate across asset classes, and given the volatility of bitcoin is around 3.7 times the volatility of gold, it would be unrealistic to expect bitcoin to match gold within investors’ portfolios in notional amounts,” Panigirtzoglou opined. The JPMorgan strategist explained that if instead, “one assumes bitcoin matches gold in risk capital terms, the implied allocation falls to $3.3 trillion/3.7 = $0.9 trillion.” He clarifies: This implies a bitcoin price of $45k, significantly lower from current levels. In other words, with the bitcoin price at $68k currently, the implied allocation to bitcoin within investors’ portfolios has already surpassed that of gold in volatility adjusted terms. Panigirtzoglou also shared his analysis of how much of bitcoin would eventually be held in ETF format. “Again if one looks at gold as a guide, around $230 billion of gold held for investment purposes is in ETF format,” he said, adding that by applying the same volatility ratio of 3.7, it implies a bitcoin ETF size of around $230 billion/3.7 = $62 billion. “In our opinion, this is a realistic target of the potential size of spot bitcoin ETFs over time perhaps within a period of two to three years, though much of the implied net inflow could represent a continued rotational shift from existing instruments and venues to ETFs,” he detailed. JPMorgan also recently warned that the price of BTC will fall to $42K after the halving in April. Panigirtzoglou said last month that the halving event and the upcoming major ethereum upgrade are “largely priced in.” Do you agree with JPMorgan about gold and bitcoin?

In addition, he pointed to a “new phase of bitcoin” as the asset class welcomes baby boomers. He further asserted that the cryptocurrency “is a report card on fiscal prudence and there’s no fiscal prudence here right now.” Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz reinforced his bullish outlook for bitcoin during a Fox Business interview on Thursday. He also shared his expectation of bitcoin reaching $100,000 this year. “We’re in a new phase for bitcoin,” the executive declared. “You’ve just opened up the boomers to bitcoin.” He elaborated that the boomer generation holds a staggering $48 trillion in “liquid wealth,” and a total wealth of around $95 trillion. Noting that boomers are now “making an allocation” in bitcoin, Novogratz stressed: “We have for the first time ever, anyone who wanted to buy bitcoin can buy it. We’re kind of in price discovery, and with price discovery, it’s hard to see where things will go.” The Galaxy Digital boss emphasized: Right now there are more buyers and sellers. Novogratz pinpointed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as the key driver propelling the price of BTC upward. “The number one thing is this ETF because it’s opened up this gigantic wealth channel to be able to buy bitcoin very easily … small allocations of big funds is a lot of bitcoin,” he said. The Galaxy Digital CEO also mentioned “macro stories,” noting that the Federal Reserve will eventually cut interest rates. He also argued that even more importantly, we have “a banking crisis today,” emphasizing that “every one of these stories plays into bitcoin.” According to Novogratz, the upcoming U.S. presidential election and fiscal policies are significant factors influencing the bitcoin market. “No one really has a lot of confidence that you’re going to see fiscal prudence when we’re adding a trillion dollars of debt in very short intervals to our budget deficit,” he opined. “And as long as the federal government is going to spend 25% of GDP on government and not 20% like we used to, bitcoin’s going to go higher — like bitcoin is a report card on fiscal prudency and there’s no fiscal prudence here right now.” When asked if he believes that BTC will reach $100,000 this year, Novogratz replied: I think so. I really do. “I like to say $100,000 because it’s a round number,” he clarified, adding: “When you’re in price discovery, you don’t know where the buying stops.” Novogratz explained that there is currently “runaway momentum” in spot bitcoin ETFs. He pointed out the significant capital inflow into these funds that “just keeps coming in.” Last week, the Galaxy Digital boss underlined the “tremendous global demand for bitcoin,” highlighting both “a new army of buyers” and “an army of salespeople” entering the market. Many people are more bullish than Novogratz, including Bitwise’s CIO who said BTC could top $200K this year.

He doesn’t expect the bull market or the alts season to “end early,” emphasizing that he expects to see “more of an ‘everything season,'” rather than a classic alts season. Bitwise’s chief investment officer, Matt Hougan, shared his perspective about the start of an “alts season” in a series of posts on social media platform X on Friday. “Alt season” refers to a period in the cryptocurrency market when alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) see significant price increases and trading volume. “Lots of discussion out there about the early start of alts season, and some surprise that it’s happening given bitcoin is ‘only’ up a few hundred percent from the lows,” he began. “By comparison, in earlier cycles, the amount of wealth generated by bitcoin rallying was smaller on an absolute dollar scale at this stage in the cycle, even though it was larger on a percentage scale,” Hougan described, elaborating: So, wealthy crypto investors are starting to take some of their bitcoin wealth and move it into alt coins. Given that many of these coins are relatively small in size, it does not take much money to significantly increase the price. “More wealth means more money to trickle down to more projects,” the Bitwise CIO noted. He pointed out another catalyst fueling the alt season. “An added catalyst … and a more exciting one … is that the tech infra for alt coins is significantly improved over past cycles. Things like the Dencun upgrade on Ethereum and the rise of Layer 2s are real technological advances that make non-monetary or tangentially-monetary uses of public blockchain much more interesting than they were in the past,” he detailed. “Combine the historically large wealth effect with better tech infrastructure and you get what we’re seeing now, with a strong alt coin rally.” The executive emphasized: Importantly, I do not think this means either the bull market or alts season will end early. The reason is: This bull market is different from prior bull markets in one important way. Hougan explained: “Historically, alts season capped the rise of bitcoin as marginal capital shifted out of bitcoin into the rest of the market. But bitcoin’s 2024 rally is being driven by entirely new money — non-crypto-native money — flowing into the ecosystem via ETFs. This suggests the ‘wealth effect’ can be ongoing for a while, as long as more new money is flowing in (via ETFs) than old money is flowing out (into alts).” He continued, “Because I think the bitcoin bull market is still in its early stages, I suspect this will be the case,” adding: The result is more of an ‘everything season’ than a classic ‘alts season.’ That’s what we’re seeing in the market and I suspect it will continue.

It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries. The famous author took to social media platform X Wednesday, calling bitcoin “on fire.” He emphasized that procrastination is the biggest mistake investors can make, urging them to start buying BTC, even if it’s only for $500. Kiyosaki stressed that bitcoin is on track to reach $300,000 per coin this year.  The price of bitcoin soared this week, breaking its all-time high, fueled by massive demand for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Following the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the famous author increased his BTC holdings. Last month, Kiyosaki predicted that bitcoin will reach $100,000 by June. He clarified that a BTC price drop wouldn’t deter him, as he would view it as a buying opportunity.

The acclaimed author has consistently advocated for bitcoin as protection against wealth erosion caused by the Federal Reserve, governmental policies, and Wall Street financiers. In January, he cautioned investors about the ballooning U.S. national debt and suggested purchasing bitcoin as a potential safeguard.

Utilizing a blend of historical pattern disruptions and the Theory of Diminishing Returns (TODR), the market analyst posits that the upcoming cycle may break from the traditional pattern of lesser yields. A Tradingview contributor, followed by over 71,000 enthusiasts, shared insights in a piece titled “Bitcoin What Is Next Narrative It Will Break?” According to this analysis by Tradingshot, if BTC maintains its current path, it’s on track to significantly deviate from its usual growth pattern, potentially heralding a groundbreaking phase for its price progression. Tradingshot explains that bitcoin (BTC) has recently overturned its cycle of narrative disruption, establishing new benchmarks in its market performance. Commencing with a dip below its former all-time high (ATH) in June 2022, followed by surpassing the 1-week moving average (MA) and undergoing its inaugural 1-week death cross and golden cross, BTC has continually surpassed expectations. Importantly, Tradingshot highlighted that BTC achieved a new ATH beyond $69,000 before the 2024 halving event, indicating strong momentum that might propel it toward the $330,000 mark. Challenging the Theory of Diminishing Returns (TODR), which suggests that each bitcoin bull cycle generates lesser returns than its predecessor, the historic profits from earlier cycles, decreasing from +53,1681% to a more recent +2,051%, are now at a pivotal juncture. If BTC’s path can indeed defy this theory, it wouldn’t just symbolize extraordinary growth but also signify a pivotal shift in how bitcoin is perceived and valued as an asset class. Tradingshot’s daring projection relies on breaking the historical Parabolic Growth Channel, an act that would constitute another narrative disruption. The analysis by Tradingshot indicates that such a breakthrough is not only feasible but likely, considering the current market trends and bitcoin’s previous endurance. “If this narrative is to break, it means that BTC would need to make a little over +2,051% during the current cycle. That suggests that we can be looking at a Cycle peak above $330,000,” Tradingshot underlines in the analysis. Whether bitcoin will truly hit or exceed the $330,000 milestone is yet to be determined, but such projections highlight the enthusiasm and conjecture that typify the crypto bull markets. Since BTC reclaimed the $60,000 price range, bitcoin price predictions of all types have come out of the woodwork. What do you think about Tradingshot’s bullish projection?

Cuban is a Shark Tank star and a minority owner of the National Basketball Association (NBA) team Dallas Mavericks. When asked how much of his portfolio is in cryptocurrency, Cuban replied: “I don’t even know how much, but it’s happy. Bitcoin, in particular. Ether … ETH to a smaller extent.” He explained: “Bitcoin is just driven by supply and demand. There’s only going to be 21 million of them.” The Shark Tank star elaborated: The more people that buy and the fewer people that sell, that means the price is going to go up. That’s just the nature of it. It’s a great store of value. That’s why I have an investment in it, because I do feel that the demand is going to exceed the number of people selling. Commenting on whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a spot ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), Cuban said: “ETH, we will see what happens with the ETF and whether or not that gets approved. But because of the way it works, it’s a little bit different and it’s a little bit more driven by utility, but there’s more and more applications coming for the utility.” A decision on the approval of a spot ethereum ETF by the SEC is anticipated in May. Analysts are divided, with some, like Standard Chartered Bank, expecting a green light, while others, like JPMorgan, remain cautious. Cuban continued: “The biggest disappointment of crypto so far has been there’s not that one application where you go to your grandma and she says, ‘I have got to get this new crypto app because all my friends are using it’ — kind of like we saw in the early days of apps with Instagram. We need that transitional application for crypto to be ubiquitous.” The billionaire concluded: But, until then, just from an investment perspective, I’m investing in bitcoin over gold all day every day, and I have said that for years.

This week, onchain analyst Willy Woo, the same market strategist who asserted in November 2023 that bitcoin will probably not fall under $30,000 again, is of the opinion that the latest surge is just a “warmup” or an introduction to significantly higher prices that will “shock” the traditional finance sector. Optimism around bitcoin (BTC) has significantly increased following the leading cryptocurrency’s ascent beyond the $60,000 mark this month. The renowned stock-to-flow (S2F) model’s creator, Plan B, forecasts “10 months of face melting FOMO,” while others are of the view that BTC could reach $1 million by 2033. In recent days, onchain analyst Willy Woo has also contributed his insights, explaining on Monday that BTC is merely getting started. “So you think we’re in a bull market?” asked Woo on the social media platform X. “We’re not, this has been the warm-up. A full fundamentals driven bull market is marked by a break of the upper blue band. When it breaks, Tradfi (traditional finance) is in for a shock.” Woo further shared a BTC macro index chart to support his statement. Woo has made some notable calls over the years and last November, he said BTC would likely never drop below $30K. “We’ll probably never see BTC going below $30k again if this onchain pattern holds true,” Woo stated three months ago. On March 6, Woo explained that capital is flowing into bitcoin. “July 2010, BTC was 0.7 cents, it popped 10x in 5 days, then another 1000x 2 years following,” Woo posted on X. “Why? BTC was introduced to global liquidity with the advent of Mt Gox. Bitcoin just got listed on the worlds stock markets which holds ~$100T of capital, and they are piling in.” Woo further added: [Technical analysis] charts will signal overbought, traders will try and short. BTC will run those charts over like a freight train. I saw this happen last cycle, late 2020, when hoards of HNW rushed in with spot buys of $1m tickets. As bitcoin’s narrative progresses, these forecasts suggest a pivotal era on the horizon, surpassing tradfi limits and expectations. With the community’s significant anticipations and Woo’s analysis of fundamental changes, the path indicates a time when BTC may not just contest but also reshape the concepts of wealth preservation and traditional investment strategies. Yet, the truth of these ambitious expectations will unfold with time, as much speculation relies on historical patterns that might not hold true in the future.

At 7:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on Thursday, the weighted global average price for bitcoin hovers between $66,800 and $67,000, whereas on the South Korean exchange Upbit, bitcoin’s price stands at $71,076 per unit. At this moment, the price of a bitcoin (BTC) in South Korea surpasses the weighted global exchange rate, as seen on cryptocurrency price aggregation sites like coinmarketcap.com and coingecko.com, by over $4,000. Data from cryptoquant.com shows that the premium in South Korea has hit a two-year peak. Other South Korean exchanges witnessing this premium include Bithumb, Korbit, and Coinone. Upbit has seen a staggering $8.2 billion in global trade volume over the last 24 hours, while Bithumb has reported $1.73 billion. The ‘Kimchi Premium’ in South Korea, often viewed as a bullish sign, indicates heightened purchasing activity within the Korean market and a strong interest in digital currencies. Historically, the Kimchi Premium has surged to 50% during bitcoin’s significant bull run in late 2017. Persisting over time due to market inefficiencies and stringent capital controls within South Korea, this price variance creates arbitrage opportunities for traders who can navigate both markets—buying BTC globally and selling it in Korea for a profit in Korean won. Yet, executing such trades is extremely challenging. Current statistics place the Korean won as the fifth most traded pair by volume and second only to the U.S. dollar in fiat currencies. While the weighted global average sees ethereum (ETH) trading at just below $3,800 per coin, in South Korea, ETH is priced at $4,029. Additionally, several leading cryptocurrencies, including DOGE and SOL, also carry premiums. Despite the hurdles in leveraging these price differences, the premium in South Korea continues to be a distinctive aspect of the cryptocurrency landscape both domestically and internationally.

Blackrock’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the Ishares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), amassed the largest single-day bitcoin purchase since its Jan. 11 launch on Tuesday. This buying surge coincided with a bitcoin price correction, following the cryptocurrency’s new all-time high set just hours earlier. On Tuesday, IBIT saw a record inflow of $788.3 million, pushing the total net inflow for all 10 new spot bitcoin ETFs to $648.3 million. This positive inflow contrasts with a $332.5 million outflow from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). In terms of bitcoin acquired, IBIT raked in 12,623.18455 BTC on Tuesday, according to the Ishares website.

Upon hitting a peak at $69,210 per unit on Mar. 5, the cryptocurrency dipped below the $60,000 threshold, only to climb again on Wednesday, positioning itself in the $66,500 to $67,500 bracket. Over the course of March 6, bitcoin’s (BTC) hourly trajectory mirrored the market’s lively dynamics. The day’s trading range stretched from $60,861 to $67,645, showcasing the cryptocurrency’s enduring allure and the prevailing optimism among traders. Against the setting of a 12.5% weekly increase, Wednesday epitomized bitcoin’s ongoing positive momentum. A nuanced examination of oscillators unveils a predominantly neutral stance, The relative strength index (RSI) at 73, the Stochastic at 85, and the commodity channel index (CCI) reached 114, all signal measured enthusiasm in market sentiment. However, the momentum indicator at 14,853 and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) level at 4,814 decisively point towards bullish signals, suggesting an undercurrent of positive momentum ready to break the surface.   The tale told by BTC’s moving averages (MAs) is overwhelmingly bullish, with all indicators from the exponential moving average (EMA) 10-day at $62,150 to the simple moving average (SMA) 200-day at $38,040 advocating the continued bullish sentiment. This alignment across short, medium, and long-term averages delineates a strong foundation of support, propelling bitcoin’s trajectory toward uncharted territories. The combination of neutral oscillators and bullish moving averages presents a complex yet promising landscape. While oscillators suggest a pause for breath, the moving averages form a bastion of support, indicating sustained interest and investment in bitcoin’s potential for growth. Following its recent recovery on Wednesday, BTC appears set to challenge its historical peak once more, as the bulls gather momentum. As we distill the essence of bitcoin’s performance on March 6, 2024, through the lens of oscillators and MAs, the prevailing sentiment leans decisively towards a bullish outlook. The robust support levels indicated by the MAs, combined with selective optimism from the oscillators, paint a picture of a currency on the verge of further ascents. Given the strong technical indicators and the underlying market dynamics, bitcoin appears set to continue its bullish trajectory. Conversely, a cautious examination of the same technical indicators could justify a bear verdict for bitcoin’s immediate future. While the bullish indicators are undeniable, the elevated positions of certain oscillators such as the RSI and Stochastic near overbought territories suggest that BTC’s current price levels might not be sustainable in the short term. This scenario posits that the market is due for a correction, as typically follows periods of rapid appreciation.

This phase is typically characterized by heightened speculation and trader anticipation about its new potential ceiling, as market participants assess its value without past benchmarks to guide expectations.

It is still very very early for bitcoin. Scaramucci has been urging investors to buy bitcoin since 2020 when Skybridge initiated a bitcoin position. “We believe bitcoin is in its early innings as an exciting new asset class,” he said at the time. Maintaining his belief that bitcoin is still a good investment and it’s not too late to invest in BTC, he similarly said earlier this month: “With bitcoin back over $50K, average investor again wondering: ‘Did I miss buying opportunity?’ Answer is hard ‘no.'” The Skybridge founder further shared his expectation that a “face-ripping rally” is incoming. After predicting a massive capital inflow from Wall Street into spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Scaramucci wrote on X Sunday: “The flows to bitcoin are going to accelerate.” At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $68,293. In January, the Skybridge Capital founder predicted that bitcoin could surpass $170,000 in 2025 if it is trading at $45,000 by the time of the next Bitcoin halving.

Predicting “an even bigger wave” of demand for bitcoin due to spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), he described: “It’s in a new era of price discovery and I think prices could go substantially higher from here.” Bitwise Asset Management’s CIO, Matt Hougan, shared his bitcoin outlook in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. Bitwise’s bitcoin ETF (BITB) is among the 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that were approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in early January. “We’re seeing enormous demand for the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF and across all these ETFs,” he shared. “You’re seeing retail investors come into these ETFs, you’re seeing hedge funds, you’re seeing RIAs [registered investment advisors] or independent financial advisors.” The chief investment officer added: I think there’s an even bigger wave coming in a few months as we start to see the major wirehouses turn on. But this has been Bitcoin’s IPO moment. It’s in a new era of price discovery and I think prices could go substantially higher from here. He elaborated: “When these ETFs first launched, they were not turned on at the major wirehouses, at the major institutions. So the initial demand out of the gate for any ETF … is primarily retail and independent financial advisors and hedge funds. So, I think that’s the primary driver, that’s what we’re seeing.” Noting that funds are flowing into ETFs from both institutions and retail investors, the Bitwise CIO described: “It’s just new demand. If you think about bitcoin pre the ETFs, there was only a small set of investors who could buy it. Now, almost everyone can buy it.” He continued: “The supply-demand dynamic is just off the hook.” Hougan explained that Bitwise said in its 2024 prediction, published in December last year, that “bitcoin would trade at new all-time highs above $80,000 a coin.” However, he admitted: “Based on what we’re seeing in our ETFs and these other ETFs, I think we have to revise that upward.” He opined: It could be $100,000. It could be $200,000. It could be higher than that. There’s simply this massive supply-demand dynamic going on. He stressed that there is “net new demand and a fixed supply,” emphasizing that there is “actually a reduction in new supply coming up in April with the halvening.” The executive noted: “Sometimes, investing is complex. Sometimes, it’s easy. With bitcoin right now, it’s just about supply-demand and there’s too much demand and not enough supply.” Recently, a $30 billion investment platform approved four spot bitcoin ETFs, including Bitwise’s bitcoin fund.

This strategy is going to take off globally. While Bailey did not identify these two capital markets, he did declare that Korea was not one of them. Microstrategy, led by Saylor, implemented a model that puts bitcoin as a fundamental part of its operations by not only holding it as a reserve asset but also operating in the way of making bitcoin acquisitions one of the priorities of the company, even issuing debt for this goal. The premise is that bitcoin will surpass the value of fiat currencies and that, in time, debt will be paid off with bitcoin earnings. Consequently, this allows Microstrategy and the companies adopting this business model to become bitcoin proxies, allowing stockholders to have an indirect bet on bitcoin. Microstrategy held 214,400 BTC as of April 26, 2024. Other companies are already following Saylor’s playbook.

Presently, the sosovalue.xyz shows IBIT’s assets under management (AUM) is valued at $19.68 billion while GBTC’s is valued at $19.65 billion. Although this could occur during today’s trading sessions or there could be a slight discrepancy in numbers, it seemingly has not happened yet, at least according to both company’s official updates. According to Blackrock’s IBIT web portal, IBIT’s BTC reserves or AUM still remain slightly lower than GBTC. However, several analysts, including Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, note that IBIT has overtaken GBTC in terms of AUM. Balchunas stated: It’s official now. IBIT is king of the category and prob will be for decades. The low fee + big boy liquidity + Ishares brand name is just too powerful (altho there’s plenty of food for everyone).

Notably, during a third of those days, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) faced outflows and neutral activity. Conversely, Blackrock’s IBIT saw inflows on most of the ten trading days. During the past ten trading days, spot bitcoin ETFs accumulated over a billion U.S. dollars in net inflows, with each day showing a positive influx. The last trading day recorded $251.9 million in net inflows and five of the 11 ETFs saw inflows while GBTC, BTCO, BRRR, EZBC, and BTCW saw no losses or gains. On May 22 and 23, GBTC saw net outflows while the rest of the gang saw inflows or neutral numbers. Blackrock’s IBIT has seen inflows for a majority of the ten day span while before this period, the fund saw a few days of no inflows or outflows. The race between GBTC and IBIT is getting awfully close in terms of bitcoin (BTC) reserves held. Time has shown with most passing trading sessions while GBTC sheds BTC from the balance sheet, IBIT picks up a cache from inflows. In fact, much of the GBTC reductions could have simply been acquired by IBIT. As of the latest data from IBIT recorded on May 24, Blackrock’s spot bitcoin fund holds approximately 287,167.74 BTC. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust once held 617,079.99 BTC on Jan. 12, 2024. It’s been 137 days since then and while GBTC has recorded a small handful of inflow days, most have been outflows. This has resulted in GBTC divesting a whopping 328,039.47 BTC worth $22.38 billion during that timeframe. Today, GBTC holds approximately 289,040.52 BTC as of May 24, 2024 records. The cache is worth $19.72 billion using exchange rates on May 28. IBIT’s cache is worth $19.59 billion using BTC’s current exchange rate. All IBIT needs to do is amass 1,872.78 BTC to catch up to GBTC’s reserves and if GBTC keeps leaking BTC from the hatch, IBIT will catch up even quicker. As the battle for dominance in the bitcoin ETF space intensifies, it’s clear that Blackrock’s IBIT is rapidly closing the gap with Grayscale’s GBTC, thanks to its consistent inflows and GBTC’s persistent outflows. This shift in market dynamics could potentially redefine the landscape of bitcoin investment vehicles in the near future, positioning Blackrock at the pinnacle. In the realm of exchange-traded funds, Blackrock is accustomed to reigning supreme. Blackrock’s Ishares ETFs are among the largest and most frequently traded ETFs worldwide. The Ishares Gold Trust (IAU) ranks as one of the largest gold-backed ETFs, while the Ishares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) is a leading ETF tracking the S&P 500 index. In the near future, the Ishares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) could become the largest spot bitcoin ETF globally. What do you think about IBIT getting closer to GBTC’s bitcoin reserves?

A senior Bloomberg analyst described this achievement as “mind-boggling” and “highly rare” for new ETFs. Other recently launched ETFs have significantly fewer institutional holders. According to 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the first quarter, 414 institutions have declared holdings in Blackrock’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the Ishares Bit oin Trust (IBIT). The SEC requires institutional investment managers overseeing over $100 million in assets to file Form 13F to disclose their securities holdings. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described this achievement as “mind-boggling,” noting that it “blows away record.” He emphasized that having even 20 holders for a newly launched ETF is “highly rare.” Other ETFs launched in January have not achieved nearly as many institutional holders as Blackrock’s IBIT and several other spot bitcoin ETFs, such as the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and the ARK 21shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB).  The largest institutional holder of IBIT shares is Millennium Management LLC, which owns 20,859,447 shares valued at approximately $844 million as of March 31. Schonfeld Strategic Advisors LLC is the second-largest institutional holder with 6,128,450 shares worth about $248 million. The U.S. State of Wisconsin Investment Board is the sixth largest institutional holder of IBIT, with 2,450,400 shares, valued at roughly $99 million. In comparison, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund has 235 institutional holders, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF has 98 institutional holders, and the ARK 21shares Bitcoin ETF has 75 institutional holders. Notably, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has a lengthy list of 619 institutional holders. However, Grayscale converted GBTC from a bitcoin trust to a spot bitcoin ETF in January, and many institutions already held GBTC prior to this conversion. As of May 16, IBIT’s bitcoin holdings stood at 276,190 BTC, valued at over $18 billion. Throughout the week, U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs experienced daily inflows totaling $948.3 million.

In contrast, IBIT recorded inflows of $131.8 million, Fidelity’s FBTC saw inflows of $344.5 million, and Ark’s spot bitcoin ETF received inflows of $243.7 million.

Through a document shared on social media, Metaplanet vows to use the different possibilities and tools available as a public company to accumulate bitcoin instead “of retaining the ever-weaker yen.” Metaplanet’s shift happens in the context of a downturn in the Japanese economy, which is currently suffering from one of the highest debt-to-gross domestic product ratios in the entire world. It is also facing a record devaluation of the yen, which has hit 34-year lows against the U.S. dollar, forcing an intervention of the Bank of Japan to stabilize the exchange rate. The company outlined the advantages of adopting this “bitcoin first” approach, including protecting itself from the yen’s depreciation, using its reserves to acquire bitcoin by issuing long-dated yen instruments, and taking advantage of the special tax regime for companies. With these measures, Metaplanet wants to become a “bitcoin proxy” for investors, in the same way that Microstrategy has become an indirect vehicle for investing in bitcoin. Metaplanet stressed that this paradigm shift “not only fortifies the company’s balancesheet against the perpetual debasement of the yen, but also positions Metaplanet as a Bitcoin-focused investment vehicle globally.” The company started buying bitcoin in April when it announced it would add 1 billion yen ($6.59M) in the form of bitcoin to its reserves. More recently, the company disclosed an additional purchase of 2 million yen ($1.25 million) in bitcoin for its treasury. Metaplanet currently holds 117.72 bitcoin.

On Tuesday, the publicly traded spot bitcoin ETFs operating in the United States registered a total trade volume of $1.17 billion. Notable entrants like Fidelity’s FBTC, Ark Invest’s ARKB, and Invesco’s BTCO experienced net inflows, yet these gains were insufficient to counteract GBTC’s $29 million decline.

During the day’s trading sessions, FBTC garnered $4 million, Blackrock’s IBIT achieved break-even status, and ARKB secured $3 million in inflows. BTCO topped the list with inflows approaching $6 million during the day’s trading sessions, coinglass.com data shows. BITB, HODL, and others reported neutral results with no gains or losses.

For the time being, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) appears to have halted the depletion of bitcoin following its public debut as a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Jan. 11, 2024. Unique among its peers, GBTC has existed since 2013 as a private, open-ended trust catering to accredited investors via the OTCQX over-the-counter market. GBTC offers investors a pathway to gain exposure to BTC without the necessity of direct acquisition. In its initial years, investors accepted a premium to hold shares in GBTC. In 2017, the premium for GBTC shares skyrocketed to 132%, and by Dec. 2020, it stood at 38.57%. This premium shifted to a discount on the net asset value (NAV) by the end of Feb. 2021, maintaining this trend until it commenced public trading in Jan. 2024. By Dec. 2022, the discount deepened to more than 48% against GBTC’s NAV. The fluctuations between initial premiums and subsequent discounts significantly impacted investors. By the time the discount period concluded and GBTC became public, a substantial amount of capital had withdrawn from the fund. The situation was further complicated by Genesis’s bankruptcy, which led to the sale of sufficient GBTC shares to acquire 32,041 bitcoins. The end of Blackrock’s IBIT’s 71-day inflow streak coincided with Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas’s remarks on GBTC’s 72-day record at the time. He pointed out that no other ETF had ever matched such a record. With the $63 million inflow on Friday, GBTC’s streak eventually concluded at total of 78 trading days. Consequently, GBTC is poised to grow its holdings by roughly 1,030 BTC, raising its balance sheet to an estimated 292,000 BTC worth $18.4 billion. Balchunas further commented on Friday’s $63 million inflow, exclaiming: Holy crap GBTC had inflows today. Their 80 day-ish streak is finally over. I had to [rub] my eyes and double check the data but it’s true. All of the U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs experienced inflows on Friday, with data revealing that the collective group garnered $378.30 million. Throughout the trading session, these ETFs amassed a total trading volume of $1.78 billion. Leading in trading volume, Blackrock’s IBIT registered around $922.81 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC witnessed $362.19 million. What do you think about GBTC’s first day of inflows?

Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) followed closely with withdrawals exceeding $167 million, while Blackrock’s IBIT reported its first negative outflow, nearing close to $37 million.  Previously, these ETFs had faced a steady decline over five consecutive days, with outflows summing up to $635 million before Wednesday’s substantial withdrawal of $563.7 million. Ark Invest’s ARKB, alongside Bitwise’s BITB and Invesco’s BTCO, experienced modest declines. On May 1, GBTC held 296,713.90 BTC, which diminished to 295,126.10 BTC by May 2. The data reveals that GBTC divested 1,587.8 BTC since the trading session on Wednesday. After observing IBIT’s initial net reduction, Nate Geraci, co-founder of ETF Institute, commented on the event. “So, Ishares Bitcoin ETF has first day of outflows ($37M),” Geraci stated on X. “Has taken in [more than $15 billion year-to-date].

Since April 24, 2024, U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs have experienced five straight days of net outflows totaling $635 million. The most significant reduction occurred last Thursday, when BTC-centric ETFs offloaded $217.6 million. Yesterday’s activity ranked as the second highest, with $161.6 million exiting the funds. Notably, GBTC has consistently posted outflows daily since it began trading on Jan. 11, 2024, shattering all previous ETF outflow records ever documented.  Two days ago, GBTC’s reserves dipped below the 300,000 BTC mark, with another 1,731.56 BTC withdrawn since Monday. As of 9:30 a.m. ET on May 1, 2024, GBTC’s holdings have decreased to 296,713.90 BTC. Grayscale values these funds at $17.55 billion in assets under management (AUM), though Wednesday’s exchange rates adjust the actual value to $17.11 billion due to BTC’s price volatility. Blackrock’s IBIT has not recorded any new inflows and maintains a balance of 274,462.04 BTC, the same as it held two days prior. Blackrock’s estimated AUM stands at $16.45 billion, but the value as of Wednesday is closer to $15.82 billion.

However, these ETFs underperformed compared to their U.S. counterparts, which had attracted a much larger sum of $4.6 billion on their initial day. The six new Hong Kong-based ETFs did not meet the expected benchmarks on Tuesday, amassing roughly $11.2 million in their initial trading sessions. Their performance significantly lagged behind the $4.6 billion achieved by ten U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs on their launch day. This comes despite earlier assertions by Zhu Haokang, an executive at China Asset Management (China AMC), who had claimed that Hong Kong’s ETFs would outdo those in the U.S. Haokang also predicted that China AMC’s offering would dominate among Hong Kong’s ETFs. This prediction held true, as China AMC’s funds captured approximately $4.75 million of the total $11.2 million raised. Regarding assets under management (AUM), China AMC’s two funds manage nearly 2,000 BTC and close to 7,000 ETH. HKEX figures show the other funds competing against China AMC’s BTC-based fund gathered 57.59% of the day’s total volume. Although the U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs have experienced decreasing volumes since March, the trading volume on April 29 in the U.S. still far exceeded Hong Kong’s debut. For example, the U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs posted $1.39 billion in volume during Monday’s trading session. Meanwhile, these American ETFs saw $51.6 million in outflows after three consecutive days of reductions.

Zhu Haokang, head of digital asset management and family wealth at China Asset Management (China AMC), anticipates that the initial trading day could surpass the record-high volumes experienced in the United States. Beijing’s Foresight News recently published an interview with China AMC executive Zhu Haokang and Wayne Huang, the Head of ETF and custody business at OSL. The China AMC executive believes that his firm’s fund will be the largest issuer among the three in terms of size and this will be revealed when trading begins. “There will be an announcement at HKEX tomorrow morning at 9:30,” OSL executive Huang confirmed. Haokang was questioned about the distinctions between the executive’s fund and its competitors. “The first difference is that, unlike the U.S. Bitcoin spot ETF, we have spot and physical subscription and redemption,” the China AMC executive said. “Additionally, Huaxia’s products differ from the other two in two ways: Huaxia Fund’s Hong Kong spot ETF is the only one with counters in Hong Kong dollars, U.S. dollars, and renminbi. Secondly, besides the listed shares, we have unlisted shares. These are features the other two do not have.” Huang explained to the reporter that offering a physical subscription represents an innovation for Hong Kong ETFs in comparison to U.S. ETFs. “It first requires the brokerage company to upgrade its license to handle virtual asset transactions. Investors send coins to OSL through this broker, and finally, transfer the equity back into the fund’s custody account to complete the entire physical subscription process,” the OSL executive noted. Furthermore, correspondence sent to Bitcoin.com News from executives from Hashkey Capital and Bosera, explained that non-Hong Kong residents are eligible to invest in the Bosera Hashkey bitcoin and ether spot ETFs if they comply with Hong Kong’s regulatory standards, including customer due diligence requirements. This update arrives amid anticipations that Hong Kong’s ETFs might attract significant investment from mainland China. “A likely approval of Hong Kong-listed bitcoin Spot ETFs could attract several billion dollars of capital as mainland investors take advantage of the Southbound Connect program,” Matrixport asserted three weeks ago. However, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas remarked two weeks ago that his team estimates they would be “lucky to get” total flows of about $500 million.

The chairman of the Swiss National Bank (SNB), Thomas Jordan, expressed skepticism at the central bank’s annual general meeting of shareholders on Friday about the prospect of the SNB purchasing bitcoins. This statement comes amid ongoing pressure from advocates to amend Swiss legislation to permit the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in the nation’s currency reserves. Jordan noted that adding bitcoin to the Swiss National Bank’s reserve assets, which include gold, foreign currencies, bonds, and shares, could have potential downsides such as increased carbon emissions. He then highlighted the energy consumption associated with bitcoin mining and transactions. He said at the meeting: We have not yet decided that we want to invest in bitcoin — actually for good reasons. Currency reserves are international payments. They have to be liquid. They have to be sustainable. And we have to be able to sell and buy them. A campaigning group headed by cryptocurrency advocate Yves Bennaïm has initiated a proposal to make a subtle yet significant amendment to a constitutional article. Currently, the article states that part of the Swiss National Bank’s reserves is “held in gold.” The proposed change seeks to modify it to “in gold and bitcoin.” Luzius Meisser, a campaigner from cryptocurrency broker Bitcoin Suisse, criticized the Swiss central bank for incurring significant losses on its investments in foreign government bonds, suggesting that investments in bitcoin could have yielded substantial profits instead. Both Bennaïm and Meisser have argued that by including BTC in the SNB’s currency reserves, Switzerland would mark its independence from the European Central Bank (ECB), emphasizing that such a step would strengthen the country’s neutrality while also diversifying the SNB’s investment portfolio.

Coinciding with the halving on April 19, the spot bitcoin ETF’s trade volume reached about $2.35 billion, while the funds saw inflows of $59.7 million. In contrast, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) observed typical outflows on Friday. Before the market opened on April 19, GBTC’s bitcoin holdings were at 306,399.09. The stash has since decreased to 304,970.43 bitcoins. This indicates a reduction of 1,428.66 bitcoins since Friday morning. On the same day, Blackrock’s IBIT reported holding 273,140.85 bitcoins, which increased to 273,596.44 by April 22. Blackrock only needs an additional 31,373.99 bitcoins to match GBTC’s holdings, yet as IBIT accumulates more, GBTC’s reserves have been diminishing. Together, IBIT and GBTC control a combined 578,566.87 bitcoins valued at $38.46 billion, representing 2.93% of the existing 19.68 million BTC in circulation. The top three spot bitcoin funds, aside from GBTC and IBIT, hold a collective stash of 229,300.57 bitcoins. Among these three, Fidelity’s FBTC possesses the majority with 152,465.48 bitcoins. Ark Invest’s ARKB fund holds 43,176 BTC and Bitwise’s BITB secures 33,659.09 bitcoins, as of April 22. These three funds alone account for a significant 1.16% of the total circulating BTC supply. Collectively, GBTC, IBIT, FBTC, ARKB, and BITB managed to scoop up 4.09% of the circulating bitcoin supply. Despite the sequential outflows, the influx observed on Friday indicates a potential recovery that could reshape market confidence. Monitoring the strategic movements of these funds will be critical as they adapt to the fluctuating dynamics of the BTC markets while holding a notable fraction of the available bitcoin supply. Additionally, six other spot BTC ETFs have been actively accumulating bitcoins, enhancing their reserves. This figure does not encompass the international exchange-traded products that currently hold BTC or the forthcoming offerings from Hong Kong.

While B3 has also bitcoin ETF contracts, futures are part of a diversification policy to reach more investors. B3, the Brazil stock exchange, registered significant demand for its bitcoin futures contracts during the launch day. The stock operator stated that the instrument reached a peak of 111,000 buy or sell orders on screen on April 17, showing a relevant demand from investors. These operations caused 7,400 bitcoin futures contracts to be traded that day. Marcos Skistymas, Listed Products Director at B3, explained the relevance of having this kind of product in B3 for Brazilian investors. “The market now has an appropriate instrument to protect itself or operate against the expectation of price variation,” he stressed, remarking on the functionality of the contracts. On the high interest that investors showed for B3’s bitcoin futures contract, he stated: This is the first derivative linked to a crypto on B3 and was highly demanded by the market, which justifies the good numbers on the first day. B3 announced the listing of these bitcoin derivatives contracts in March when it was greenlighted by the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM). The Brazilian stock exchange already has 14 cryptocurrency ETF products listed, but the release of a native bitcoin futures contract was a consequence of a diversification strategy of the company, according to Felipe Gonçalves, superintendent of interest and currency products. Each contract has a value of 0.1 BTC, and the instrument takes the Nasdaq Bitcoin Reference Price (NQBTC) index as a reference for settlements. The contracts are negotiated in Brazilian reais and are financially settled, meaning that there is no purchase or sale of cryptocurrency involved. The contacts are settled each month.

The newly launched spot bitcoin ETFs have been active on the stock market for 99 days, having commenced trading on Jan. 11, 2024. Throughout this period, they have experienced significant trading volumes, marked by substantial inflows from entities such as IBIT and FBTC, as well as notable outflows, particularly from GBTC. During Thursday’s trading sessions, the market observed another net outflow totaling $4.3 million, following a more substantial outflow of $165 million the previous day. In total, $2.58 billion was exchanged across the 11 U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETFs on April 18, with Blackrock’s IBIT accounting for $1.28 billion of that volume. As of two days ago, Blackrock’s IBIT managed 272,548.58 BTC. By Friday, April 19, the figures on the website indicated a holding of 273,140.85 BTC, valued at $17.3 billion. This data reveals that, since Wednesday morning, IBIT has absorbed an additional 592.27 BTC from the market. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has experienced ongoing outflows, diminishing its BTC reserves further. As of Wednesday morning, GBTC possessed 309,871.38 BTC, but by today, the total has decreased to 306,399.09 BTC, indicating a withdrawal of 3,472.29 bitcoins. Amid these consecutive days of outflows from spot bitcoin ETFs, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas emphasized on the social media platform X that such a cooldown is entirely typical. “Some perspective on the ‘it’s so over’ ETF flows lately,” Balchunas wrote on X. “[It is] totally normal for ETF category to cool off after breathtaking pace like this, esp w/ price down 12% in past 5 days (more on that in a minute). As far as the price drop, the ETF analyst blamed the so-called ‘hodler’ class. Balchunas concluded: Back to the 12% price drop in 5 days: 1) that’s on the [bitcoin] natives, the so-called HODLers. So again, if you feel the need to point finger, just remember the call is coming from inside the house. 2) even [with] the price drop [bitcoin] is up 144% since Blackrock’s filing last June and 47% YTD, which is 10x the return of QQQ = if you are depressed with those returns you should [probably] seek medical help.

Grayscale’s GBTC continued to report reductions in its bitcoin (BTC) reserves following two days of significant outflows—a $55.1 million drop on Friday and a $36.7 million decline on Monday. The reduction continued into Tuesday’s session with a $58 million decrease. Trading volume on Tuesday reached $2.45 billion, which was lower than the volumes recorded on Monday and Friday.

Although there were anticipations of notable capital inflows into the Hong Kong ETFs, Balchunas mentioned that while it’s a positive step forward, he emphasized that Hong Kong’s ETFs would be “lucky to get” around $500 million in total flows.  On Monday, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) greenlit a series of spot ETFs linked to the top two cryptocurrencies by market cap — bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH). This development has sparked enthusiasm within the cryptocurrency community. Before this approval, the Singapore-based crypto firm Matrixport had speculated that the ETFs might draw around $25 billion in BTC demand. “A likely approval of Hong Kong-listed bitcoin Spot ETFs could attract several billion dollars of capital as mainland investors take advantage of the Southbound Connect program,” Matrixport remarked on Friday. Nevertheless, not everyone is on board with this prediction. For instance, the Southbound Connect program only allows eligible and qualified mainland investors in the GBA to invest in wealth management products through Hong Kong (HK) banks, adhering to specific operational guidelines. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, challenged the feasibility of the $25 billion figure and labeled it “insane.” “Latest on HK spot bitcoin ETFs,” Balchunas wrote. “They have been approved to exist but not launch (yet). Rumor has it launching next [week] so to not compete [with] Dubai conf. Don’t expect a lot of flows (I saw one estimate of $25B that’s insane). We think they’ll be lucky to get $500 [million],” he added. Balchunas further elaborated on the reasons behind his viewpoint.  First, he said the overall Hong Kong ETF market is relatively small, valued at just $50 billion, and Chinese residents are generally not permitted to invest in these ETFs officially. Secondly, the issuers that received approval—Bosera, China AMC, and Harvest—are smaller entities, lacking the involvement of major players such as Blackrock. Thirdly, he noted that the market ecosystem in Hong Kong is less liquid and efficient, which could result in these ETFs experiencing wider spreads and premium discounts. Additionally, Balchunas said the fees for these ETFs are expected to range between 1-2%, which is considerably higher than the low fees found in the U.S. market. The ETF analyst acknowledged that while the introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs in other countries is beneficial, their impact is minor compared to the dominant U.S. market. He added: Just to be clear, all this is clearly positive for bitcoin as it opens up more avenues to invest, I’m just saying its child’s play vs U.S. Also long-term some of this could go away: more [liquid], tighter spreads, lower fees and bigger issuers involved. But short/medium term we have more moderate expectations. That’s all. Since the approval of U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, Balchunas has maintained a level-headed approach, contrasting with the often hyped-up bullish forecasts prevalent in the crypto community. He provided a reality check to bitcoin’s ‘hodler class’ when ARKB experienced significant outflows, surpassing those of Grayscale’s GBTC in the first week of April. At that point, the price volatility was more likely attributed to long-term holders selling off their positions rather than to ETF outflows.

Metrics from Thursday reveal GBTC held 316,193.43 bitcoins, but after a decline of 2,048.23 bitcoins, the fund’s holdings reduced to 314,145.2 bitcoins. Data from Wednesday, April 10, 2024, records that U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs observed $123.7 million in positive inflows. The positive trend continued into Thursday with $91.3 million in inflows but ceased on Friday when the ETFs registered negative outflows. Data from coinglass.com reveals outflows totaling $55.1 million, with GBTC leading these reductions. Blackrock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC experienced inflows on Friday, yet these were insufficient to offset the overall decrease on Friday. Just two days prior, IBIT managed 266,580.08 BTC and currently oversees 269,313.77 BTC valued at $18.92 billion. On April 11, FBTC held 151,787.77 BTC, which increased to 151,853.34 BTC by the following day. This indicates that since Wednesday, Blackrock and Fidelity’s spot BTC offerings have absorbed an additional 2,799.26 BTC from the market. Conversely, Ark Invest’s ARKB saw a minor decrease from 43,748 BTC on April 11 to 43,736 BTC as of April 12. Meanwhile, Bitwise’s BITB has added to its holdings, escalating from 33,342.90 BTC in its last report to a current total of 33,501 bitcoins. Therefore, despite the outflows on Friday and GBTC’s decline by 2,048.23 BTC, the reserves of IBIT, FBTC, and BITB have expanded. This week also signifies the point where GBTC has surpassed a net divestment of 300,000 bitcoins since Jan. 12, 2024.

Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, recently said that IBIT is “the fastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs.” He added that he is “very bullish on the long-term viability of Bitcoin” and is “pleasantly surprised” by the retail demand for Blackrock’s spot bitcoin ETF. Last week, Blackrock filed an amendment to its IBIT prospectus, revealing that the fund now has nine authorized participants. They are ABN AMRO Clearing USA, Citadel Securities, Citigroup Global Markets, Goldman Sachs, Jane Street Capital, JP Morgan Securities, Macquarie Capital (USA), UBS Securities, and Virtu Americas. Blackrock has also filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot ether ETF. Despite some optimism surrounding potential SEC approval of spot ether ETF applications by May’s deadline, skepticism is growing. Jan Van Eck, CEO of investment firm Vaneck, recently expressed his doubts, anticipating the rejection of his firm’s application in May. Moreover, there are reports that the SEC may be trying to classify ether as a security. Fink, however, believes that even if ETH is classified as a security, Blackrock can still launch a spot ether ETF.

Sources familiar with the matter have told China’s Securities Times that several Chinese entities are expressing a keen interest in establishing spot bitcoin ETFs. According to the publication, Beijing’s Harvest Fund has taken the lead by filing an application with Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). Founded in 1999, Harvest Fund (HGIUK) is dedicated to catering to an international clientele, particularly those investing in China. Amid sustained downturns in the domestic stock market, HGIUK is witnessing an uptick in demand for cross-border investments, as Chinese investors search for more lucrative opportunities overseas.

Schiff ramped up his criticism of the crypto this week as the price of gold rose and bitcoin dipped slightly. “I expect gold’s rise and bitcoin’s fall to accelerate. Don’t say I didn’t warn you,” Schiff wrote. Gold advocate Peter Schiff seized on last week’s market movements to criticize bitcoin and promote gold, with gold prices experiencing a stronger-than-anticipated rise. Schiff highlighted in a post on X Friday that gold gained 4%, silver surged 10%, and gold mining ETFs (GDX and GDXJ) rose 7% and 8% respectively, while bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) fell 5% and Microstrategy’s stock (MSTR) plummeted 16%. “This likely represents a major shift. I expect gold’s rise and bitcoin’s fall to accelerate. Don’t say I didn’t warn you!” he emphasized. Commenting on Schiff’s post, veteran trader Peter Brandt wrote: Come on Peter, put things in a broader perspective. I like gold too — I am long a bunch — but which race horse has done better since BTC’s inception? Brandt also included a chart that “represents the number of oz. of gold to purchase one bitcoin,” the veteran trader explained. “In the past 50 years, gold price has increased at CAGR of 5.2%, barely exceeding the U.S. Consumer Price Index,” Brandt noted. A vocal bitcoin proponent, Brandt believes that BTC is vying to replace fiat currency as the primary store of value. In February, he raised his bitcoin price target for the current bull market cycle to $200K. On Saturday, Schiff touted gold’s outperformance compared to bitcoin in a follow-up post on X: “On Oct. 21, 2021, it took 37 ounces of gold to buy one bitcoin. Today it takes only 29. That’s a 22% decline, an official bear market.” He insisted that BTC “has underperformed gold for the past 2.5 years.” The gold bug defended his analysis after many users accused him of cherry-picking the time frame to favor gold, stating: “I’m not cherry picking. You have to measure an asset relative to its all-time high.” Schiff further opined: Bitcoin is far more likely to lose 90% of its current market cap than to amass another 90% of gold’s market cap. He further detailed: “From 2000 to 2011 the gold price rose from below $400 to above $1,900. That was a 5x move. A similar move from the $2K breakout will send gold to $10,000. Given the far weaker fiscal position of the U.S. now and potential for larger QE, the next move should happen much quicker.” What are your thoughts on Peter Schiff’s arguments?

Additionally, the Hut 8 executive emphasized the forthcoming halving event’s “big impact,” noting a surge in demand juxtaposed with a reduction in available bitcoins.  With just 15 days remaining until the Bitcoin reward halving, the block subsidies will be halved from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block afterward. This adjustment will decrease miners’ daily rewards from the current 900 BTC to 450 following block height 840,000. In a recent conversation between DL News and Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot, it was revealed that there is a significant surge in demand these days. Genoot revealed to the reporter Thomas Carreras that prominent financial institutions have approached Hut 8 (TSX: HUT) to procure bitcoin (BTC) amid shortages on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. “We’ve had banks reach out to us to try to buy our bitcoin because of the supply shortages on these different exchanges,” stated the Hut 8 executive to Carreras. This statement coincides with the period during which ten major U.S. exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have accumulated over 500,000 BTC since Jan. 11, 2024. The CEO of Hut 8 also discussed the imminent Bitcoin reward halving event, anticipated to occur at some point between April 18 and April 20, contingent upon block intervals. “The supply coming down by 50%, from 900 Bitcoin to 450 Bitcoin per day, also makes a big impact, because now you have increasing demand but less supply,” Genoot remarked. Over the past month, Hut 8 shares have surged by 24%, with a 3.5% increase recorded over the last five days.

This week, Proshares revealed two newly introduced bitcoin funds, known as the Ultra Bitcoin ETF (BITU) and the Ultrashort Bitcoin ETF (SBIT). BITU sets its sights on delivering twice the daily returns of bitcoin, whereas SBIT seeks to provide twice the inverse of bitcoin’s daily returns. These introductions mark the first debut of such BTC-focused ETFs in the U.S. exchange-traded product arena. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas discussed the launch on Tuesday via the social media platform X. “The first ever 2x and -2x spot bitcoin ETFs hit the market today from Proshares,” Balchunas wrote. “BITU and SBIT (tickers could have been better). BITX is 2x but it tracks futures and BITI is -1x but is also futures. Fee 95bps on both. Haven’t traded too much so far, under $1m,” the analyst added. Proshares led the way with the debut of the first BTC-focused exchange-traded fund in October 2021, utilizing futures contracts rather than operating as a spot BTC ETF. Following this inaugural launch, Proshares rolled out a series of U.S.-based ETFs including a short bitcoin-linked ETF (BITI), a short ether-linked ETF (SETH), an ETF targeting ethereum’s performance (EETH), and a combined bitcoin and ethereum ETF named BETE. Unlike spot ETFs, none of the aforementioned funds employ crypto reserves. “BITU and SBIT are designed to address the challenge of acquiring leveraged or short exposure to bitcoin, which can be onerous and expensive,” Proshares CEO Michael L. Sapir remarked on Tuesday. “BITU offers investors the opportunity to pursue magnified bitcoin returns or target a level of exposure with less money at risk.

The investment bank launched a crypto trading desk in 2021 and continues to build on it. Bitcoin surged to a record high last week but has since undergone a correction, dipping below $63,000 on Tuesday. Commenting on bitcoin’s recent price surge, McDermott stressed: The price action … has still been driven by retails primarily. But it’s the institutions that we’ve started to see come in … You really see now the appetite has transformed. “Last year was tough but just coming through to this year we’ve seen a big sea-change not only in terms of the types of clients but also in terms of volumes,” the Goldman analyst noted, adding that spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that were launched in early January prompted a “psychological shift.” Major banks, including Goldman Sachs, are eyeing the potential of blockchain technology beyond cryptocurrencies, believing that the technology could revolutionize asset trading, enabling the issuance of digital versions of traditional assets like bonds. While pilot projects have shown promise, routine issuance and a flourishing secondary market for these digital assets haven’t yet materialized. McDermott opined: I do think over time we’ll start to see more asset classes get tokenised and actually get some scale – but maybe that’s one or two years down the line.

He underscored that, in his view, bitcoin does not qualify as a reliable “store of value.” It hasn’t served as one and is marked by extreme volatility, Buckley noted.

The prospectus outlines that the fund will encompass investments such as 144A securities, asset-backed securities, convertible securities, and “bitcoin exposure.” Blackrock notes that by investing in a bitcoin ETP, shareholders of the fund will bear their respective share of the fund’s costs and, indirectly, those of the bitcoin ETP.

Anthony Scaramucci, former White House comms director and founder of Skybridge Capital, has commented on the chances that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway could purchase bitcoin in the future. Scaramucci, a cryptocurrency proponent, acknowledges that Buffett, known as the “Oracle of Omaha,” has a negative image of crypto. However, this might not matter due to the circumstances that Berkshire Hathaway is facing. Scaramucci declared: Warren Buffett never bought Microsoft even though he played bridge with Bill Gates every month. And now he owns Apple. Wouldn’t be be ironic if he winds up buying bitcoin as a hedge for his cash ? Never say never. According to recent reports, Berkshire Hathaway had $167.6 billion in cash during Q4 2023, breaking its firm record registered during Q3. This cash accumulation is likely derived from the lack of opportunities that the firm has faced. In its annual letter to shareholders, Buffett stated that outside the U.S. “there are essentially no candidates that are meaningful options for capital deployment at Berkshire.” This poses a problem for the conglomerate, which has accumulated enough money to purchase all the teams in the NFL, having a combined value of $163.5 billion. Going from crypto detractor to crypto believer seems unlikely for Buffett, who has qualified Bitcoin as a “gambling token,” stating that it doesn’t have any intrinsic value, and also likened it to “rat poison squared.” Nonetheless, Scaramucci believes that even as a clear contrarian, Buffett could purchase bitcoin to hedge this large amount of cash held by Berkshire Hathaway.

Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, highlighted this achievement on X, noting that IBIT had attracted more cash than 99.98% of ETFs, a staggering feat for a fund that’s barely over two weeks old. Some of this influx of investment can be attributed to a strategic shift among asset managers. Balchunas gives the example of Canadian asset manager Redwood, which transitioned from the Canadian Purpose Bitcoin ETF with fees greater than 1%, to the more cost-effective IBIT, which offers free management for the first $5 billion in assets and a modest 25 basis points fee thereafter.

This places IBIT in an elite group, not just within the realm of cryptocurrency funds but across the broader ETF market. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also makes an appearance in the top 10 of ETF asset gatherers this year, securing the eighth position with $2.7 billion in inflows. However, despite the impressive start for these bitcoin-centric funds, the overall investment pace into new spot bitcoin ETFs has shown signs of deceleration. Yet, Blackrock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC distinguish themselves as the only funds among their peers to have maintained a consistent positive flow of investment since their market debut. This achievement underscores the growing investor appetite for bitcoin as a legitimate asset class within diversified investment portfolios. The performance of Blackrock’s ETF is particularly noteworthy, with Bloomberg’s Balchunas reporting a top 0.02% placement against an estimated 10,000 ETFs worldwide, a testament to the robust demand for cryptocurrency investment products.

This trend has been particularly pronounced following the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs, offering investors streamlined access to the cryptocurrency. In a recent video on ARK Invest’s Youtube channel, CEO Cathie Wood said there is a significant shift among investors moving from traditional gold investments to bitcoin. This shift, according to Wood, has become increasingly apparent following the introduction of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), providing a less cumbersome access to the cryptocurrency. During a dialogue with Brett Winton, ARK’s chief futurist, Wood pointed to bitcoin’s remarkable resilience and growth, especially in times of financial instability. She recalled the instance of March 2023, when the U.S. faced a regional bank crisis, leading to a 40% surge in bitcoin’s value as the regional bank index plummeted. “Bitcoin shot up 40% as the KRE, the regional bank index, was imploding. And here again, the regional bank index is acting up, and we are seeing Bitcoin catch a bid again,” Wood stated, underscoring bitcoin’s emerging role as a “flight to safety” asset. Wood shared a compelling chart illustrating bitcoin’s price in gold, showcasing a strong, long-term uptrend. This trend, she explained, signifies bitcoin’s ongoing process of partially replacing gold as a preferred investment choice. “This chart just shows you that even relative to gold, Bitcoin has been rising. There’s now a substitution into Bitcoin, and we think that is going to continue,” she remarked.  Addressing the volatility following the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs, including ARK 21shares Bitcoin ETF on January 11, Wood explained that the subsequent price correction was anticipated. Despite a 20% drop in bitcoin’s price post-launch, Wood remains optimistic, citing that 15 million of the 19.5 million bitcoin currently in circulation have not moved in over 155 days, suggesting a strong holding pattern among investors. ARK Invest’s strategic movements in the cryptocurrency space extend beyond bitcoin. The firm has significantly invested in Coinbase stock (COIN), although it has scaled back its holdings since June 2023. As of now, ARK holds 7.187 million shares in Coinbase, valued at $843 million, reflecting its continued bullish stance on the crypto sector despite market fluctuations.

In addition, Boneparth further highlighted the contrasts in approach between traditional trade finance behemoths such as Blackrock and Fidelity, and those more ingrained in the cryptocurrency world, such as Bitwise and Vaneck. In a recent discussion, Douglas Boneparth, president and founder of Bona Fide Wealth, shed light on the emerging spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the categorization of bitcoin as an asset class. Engaging with Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, on the “Bloomberg ETF IQ” show, Boneparth compared bitcoin to what he terms digital gold. “I do view it in its most simplistic form as digital gold, as a digital store of value,” Boneparth said. “Now granted store of value and the price action of bitcoin might not go hand in hand, but also, you know, the room for alternative investments in a portfolio. I think clients are always seeking things that aren’t correlated or have the ability to produce alpha. You know, to a degree, these are things that clients will always have some appetite for.” When queried about the volume of incoming inquiries regarding the new spot bitcoin ETF, particularly from the ‘baby boomer’ generation, the Bona Fide Wealth president noted a lack of significant inbound calls. “I definitely wanted to see a handful of people, particularly baby boomers, who had no interest in moving money to an exchange to buy cryptocurrency to get a position there,” Boneparth remarked. “I mostly work with mid to late 30-something-year-olds and we’ve been having conversations and educational conversations around cryptocurrency and bitcoin. Well before there was product offering.” During the show, host Katie Greifeld inquired of Boneparth about his perception of the differences between native crypto companies such as Bitwise and established trade finance firms like Blackrock and Fidelity. Boneparth referenced Bitwise’s contributions to Bitcoin Core developers, suggesting that for those who are “a believer in all things blockchain and crypto,” a crypto-native fund might be more appealing. Ultimately, Boneparth concluded, it remains to be seen which will surpass the other as time progresses. “This is something that do they have an edge over the, you know, massive shop that is a Blackrock or Fidelity and I know their crypto desks are pretty robust and they have a lot of smart people,” Boneparth told Greifeld. “They’re just the same.

In a strategic move to gain traction in the highly competitive spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, Invesco and Galaxy Asset Management have reduced the fee for their joint spot bitcoin ETF, the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO). This decision, announced on Monday, marks the latest move in the ongoing fee war amongst issuers of this new financial product. The fee reduction brings BTCO’s expense ratio down from 0.39% to 0.25%. Additionally, Invesco has announced a waiver of these fees for the first six months or until the ETF reaches $5 billion in assets under management (AUM). This aggressive pricing strategy aims to bolster the fund’s appeal among investors and compete more effectively with dominant players in the sector. Despite the fee cut, BTCO is not the lowest-cost option in the market. Franklin Templeton’s spot bitcoin ETF holds this distinction with a post-waiver expense ratio of 0.19%. However, the reduced fee places BTCO in a more competitive position against other industry players. Notably, Grayscale’s ETF remains the most expensive among the new offerings and is experiencing significant outflows. Since the U.S. regulators green-lighted the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs earlier this month, there has been a noticeable shift in investor inflows. Industry giants such as Blackrock Inc. and Fidelity have captured a significant market share, attracting combined inflows of approximately $4 billion, representing roughly 70% of the total spot bitcoin ETF inflows.

This is at the root of our decision to not offer crypto products, whether our own or others,” the executive described, emphasizing: While crypto has been classified as a commodity, it’s an immature asset class that has little history, no inherent economic value, no cash flow, and can create havoc within a portfolio. “With equities, you own a share of a company that produces goods or services, and many also pay dividends. With bonds, you get a stream of interest payments. Commodities are real assets that meet consumption needs, have inflation-hedging properties, and can play a role in certain portfolios,” she noted. Nonetheless, she expressed Vanguard’s interest in blockchain technology, stating: “We do have a lot of interest in blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies. We believe its application to a number of other uses besides crypto will make capital markets more efficient, and we’ve been actively involved in research to use blockchain technology.” Regarding whether Vanguard is planning to launch its own spot crypto ETFs, Jackson said: Given the current state of crypto as an asset class, Vanguard does not have plans to launch its own bitcoin ETF or any crypto-related products. “When deciding what investment products to offer, we consider a range of factors, including whether we believe they have enduring investment merit and meet our clients’ needs,” she clarified. “While the discussion about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, has increased recently, we do not currently believe that there is an appropriate role for them to play in long-term portfolios. A rigorous process guides every Vanguard product launch.” What do you think about Vanguard’s explanation regarding spot bitcoin ETFs?

Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s lead ETF analyst, advises, “don’t sleep on Schwab, they’re never first to market in anything but they make back impact when they come in.” Recent conversations have surfaced about Charles Schwab gearing up to introduce a spot bitcoin ETF, hot on the heels of the debut of ten U.S.-based ETFs on Jan. 11, 2024. In her article on riabiz.com, Lisa Shidler touches upon this development, remarking that “Charles Schwab Corp. is being cryptic about cryptocurrency.” Shidler delves into how Schwab might leverage its extensive scale and competitive low-fee pricing strategy to make a bold move with its bitcoin ETF. She further explores this topic in a discussion with Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst. “They may shock the world and offer something that is 10-basis-points in a few months,” Balchunas told Shidler. “I wouldn’t be surprised. They could have something up their sleeve. They might like to do something like that.” Morningstar analyst Bryan Armour clarified to Shidler that this approach is typical of Schwab’s operational style. “It’s consistent with what we’ve seen from Schwab, overall. They’re more methodical with their approach to product development than others,” Armour told the riabiz.com reporter. “They trade the first-mover advantage for having a more thoughtful lineup that can stick with them for the long-term.” On the social media platform X, ETF Institute co-founder Nate Geraci agrees with Balchunas and stated: Schwab to enter spot bitcoin ETF race? I say it’s already [a] foregone conclusion. Agree [with] Eric [and] believe will happen (sooner rather than later). Charles Schwab offers a full range of brokerage, banking, and financial advisory services including dealing with exchange-traded products (ETPs). Schwab founded in 1971 offers a wide range of ETPs, including complex ETPs, leveraged, and inverse ETPs. On X Balchunas explained that Schwab could get aggravated by Fidelity’s significant lead in the spot bitcoin ETF race. “Don’t sleep on Schwab,” Balchunas said. “They’re never first to market in anything but they make back impact when they come in [with] dirt cheap fee [plus] 30 [million] active brokerage accts. And they do NOT like Fidelity, so FBTC’s success could annoy them to file something sooner rather than later.” What do you think about the predictions that Charles Schwab may enter the spot bitcoin ETF race?

Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have overtaken silver to become the second-largest commodity in the U.S. ETF market, trailing only gold. The recent approval of spot bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has catalyzed this shift. Bitcoin ETFs, including the newly converted Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), command nearly $28 billion in assets under management (AUM). This figure starkly contrasts with the $11 billion AUM of silver ETFs, as reported by etfdb.com. Gold maintains its leading position with approximately $95 billion in AUM, but the swift rise of spot bitcoin ETFs is a testament to the digital asset’s growing acceptance and popularity. bitcoin, often touted as the digital counterpart to gold, has demonstrated its robust appeal in the ETF market, a domain traditionally dominated by conventional commodities. The initial response to spot bitcoin ETFs was overwhelmingly positive, with an impressive $9.6 billion in trading volume recorded within the first three days of trading, a historic figure in the ETF market. To determine how bitcoin ETFs surpassed silver in AUM, a simple analysis of the holdings was undertaken. Initially, the total number of bitcoins held in various ETFs, excluding GBTC, was sourced from a post by CC15Capital on X. This figure was then combined with the number of bitcoins held by GBTC, as reported by Coinglass. Multiply this aggregated total by the current spot price of Bitcoin for an approximate value of $28 billion. This figure is higher than the AUM for silver ETFs, as listed on etfdb.com. Grayscale’s conversion of its existing Bitcoin trust into an ETF played a pivotal role in this shift, creating the world’s largest spot bitcoin ETF overnight. In fact, some ETF market watchers like James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas caution against reading too much into the rapidity with which bitcoin overtook silver. Seyffart, a Bloombert ETF analyst, explained in a post on X that interest in spot bitcoin didn’t ramp up with the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs. Much of it was driven by Greyscale’s GBTC conversion. Seyffart said, “that means it was #2 as soon as the conversion happened! So not really “news” per se haha.” Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, agreed with this interpretation, saying, “yeah I get the whole bigger than silver excitement but i just don’t count it as impressive given 95% of was simply GBTC converting.” He added, “These milestones [are] MUCH harder when you [have a] brand new ETF, dif standards of measure.” Do you think spot bitcoin ETFs will some day unseat gold ETFs for the number one spot?

Its most recent balance sheet shows that Tesla continues to hold bitcoin valued at $184 million. Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has raised concerns about the high-interest rate environment affecting the auto industry. Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) released its third-quarter earnings results on Wednesday. The company reported $23.35 billion in revenue and $1.85 billion in profits, marking declines compared to the previous quarter. Despite its earnings missing Wall Street expectations, the electric car company’s balance sheet still shows net digital assets of $184 million. This is the fourth straight quarter that Tesla has recorded the same value for its digital assets, which mostly consist of bitcoin (BTC). Tesla invested $1.5 billion in BTC in Q1 2021 but sold 75% of its holdings in Q2 2022. Musk explained at the time that the company is “certainly open” to increasing its bitcoin holdings in the future, noting that the sale was due to concerns about the company’s overall liquidity, “given Covid shutdowns in China.” Tesla’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also states: “We may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions.” In January, Tesla’s SEC filing showed the fair market value of the company’s BTC holdings was $191 million at the end of 2022. The electric car company also accepts the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE) for some merchandise, which accounted for an “immaterial amount” of digital assets as stated in the company’s SEC filing. During Tesla’s Q3 earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Elon Musk highlighted several concerns affecting his company’s profitability, including the high interest rate environment. He stressed: I am worried about the high interest rate environment that we’re in. I just can’t emphasize this enough that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment. “As interest rates rise, the proportion of that monthly payment that is interest increases naturally,” Musk said. “If interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it’s that much harder for people to buy the car.

Draper recommended having at least two payrolls worth of cash in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to avoid being affected by bank failures like the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Tim Draper, a well-known venture capitalist and crypto enthusiast, has recommended bitcoin as part of his cash diversification advice for business founders. Draper, known for winning an auction of 30,000 bitcoins from the U.S. Marshals back in 2014, and for his bitcoin price predictions, posted a document on Twitter that comments on several considerations businesses should make in the face of bank failures. The document, which presents seven different ways to avoid a cash crunch, states: Since boards and management are responsible for making payroll, even in times of crisis, it is important to build out contingency plans for bank failures that could happen more and more often if government continues to print money and whipsaw interest rates to counteract inflation caused by the over-printing of money. Draper comments that the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) showed the importance of having a sound contingency strategy in uncertain times. Per different reports, many tech startups that were dependent on Silicon Valley Bank faced a period of uncertainty when the bank collapsed, not having the necessary liquidity to complete payroll payments. However, the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) averted the situation and made customers’ deposits whole under a systemic risk exception approved by the Federal Reserve. One of the key points in Draper’s cash management plan, which was designed with the help of Wharton school individuals, is the diversification of banking risk. Draper states that businesses can no longer rely on just one institution to manage their cash, advising to keep at least six months of short-term cash in two banks — one local and one global bank. Also, Draper advises keeping at least two payrolls worth of cash in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, maintaining excess money in assets saleable for emergencies. He supports taking these measures by stating: For the first time in many years, governments are taking over banks and governments themselves are at risk of becoming insolvent.

Bank of America analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss noted “that investors may view bitcoin as a relative safe haven as macro uncertainty continues.” Market strategists from Bank of America’s securities division, Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss, detailed this week that bitcoin and gold have been highly correlated in recent times. The news follows the recent report published by the crypto data provider Kaiko, which says bitcoin has been less volatile than the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices. According to the Bank of America strategists, bitcoin’s (BTC) price fluctuations, in terms of other global assets, have caused investors to think BTC is a safe-haven asset. “A decelerating positive correlation with SPX/QQQ and a rapidly rising correlation with XAU indicate that investors may view bitcoin as a relative safe haven as macro uncertainty continues and a market bottom remains to be seen,” Bank of America’s securities division analysts wrote. On Monday, October 24, both bitcoin (BTC) and gold prices have been range bound, and have been less volatile in comparison to equity markets. BTC is trading for just above $19K per unit, while an ounce of .999 fine gold is exchanging hands for 1,646.70 nominal U.S. dollars. Bank of America’s Shah and Moss have been monitoring the 40-day correlation with gold, which is around 0.50 this week. The 0.50 rating is a lot closer and shows a stronger correlation to the precious metal than the zero rating the leading crypto asset BTC recorded in August. The move comes at a time when macro uncertainty has heightened, and analysts have warned that U.S. Federal Reserve rate hikes could cause a U.S. Treasuries liquidity crisis. Market observers expect an aggressive rate hike next month, but strategists also believe the Fed will pivot by December. Both gold and BTC have fallen a great deal since the two asset’s all-time price highs. Gold for instance tapped a lifetime price high against the U.S. dollar on March 8, 2022, when it reached $2,074 per ounce. Gold has lost 20.49% against the U.S. dollar since the all-time high 230 days ago.

Almaty-headquartered Eurasian Bank and the Kazakhstan-based crypto exchange Intebix have reported conducting what they presented as the first crypto-related transaction in the country involving a digital asset trading platform, a banking institution, and a customer. The deal, in which cryptocurrency was acquired with local fiat, was announced at the Digital Bridge 2022 forum. “This precedent makes it possible for Kazakhstanis to legally purchase cryptocurrencies for tenge, while Eurasian Bank’s proprietary solution made it possible to set one of the lowest fees in the world for such a transaction,” the bank said in a press release.

In May of this year, regulators approved pilot regulations permitting crypto transactions in Kazakhstan, under certain conditions. In order to participate in the project, crypto exchanges are required to obtain a license while banks need to adhere to the adopted rules. The government maintains that the framework meets international standards in terms of transaction oversight and security.

President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev expressed his administration’s readiness to support the further development of the project to facilitate crypto asset exchange in the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC), the Central Asian nation’s financial hub, if the trial is successful. Kazakhstan intends to become a leading player in the field of new digital technologies, the cryptocurrency ecosystem and regulated digital mining, Tokayev emphasized. “If this financial instrument shows further demand and security, then it will certainly receive full legal recognition,” he was quoted as saying.

In a new report, the eurozone’s monetary authority also claims stablecoins, among other options, are “problematic.” Cross-border payments should be immediate, cheap, universal, and settled in a secure medium, the European Central Bank remarks in a recently published report. For the first time, the “holy grail” of such transactions is within reach, thanks to declining data transfer costs, the birth of innovative concepts, and global collaboration aiming to enhance these payments, the regulator says in the recently published paper. The review, co-authored by ECB’s Director-General for Market Infrastructure and Payments Ulrich Bindseil and economist George Pantelopoulos, explores various ways to achieve these objectives. The experts have assessed several alternatives that are currently available, including cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, stablecoins, modernized correspondent banking, fintech solutions, and digital currencies issued by central banks, or CBDCs. Of these, bitcoin is the “least credible” and hence unlikely to be the “holy grail” of cross-border payments, they say, pointing to three main reasons for their conclusion: an inefficient proof-of-work mechanism, comparative advantages resulting from regulatory gaps that will be closed by authorities as they allegedly undermine anti-money laundering regulations, and the leading crypto’s unsuitability as a means of domestic payment as it’s “inherently unstable” in terms of purchasing power. Stablecoins, although they take an intermediate spot, can be even “more problematic” due to the employment of closed-loop solutions, their market power and fragmentation, the report notes. Currency substitution and the threat to monetary sovereignty have been listed as risks, too. Nevertheless, the authors admit they can be efficient as means of payment for several reasons, including their stable value bound to existing fiat currencies and their potential to have universal reach. Two other solutions, the European Central Bank insists, combine technical feasibility and relative simplicity while maintaining a competitive and open architecture by avoiding the dominance of a small number of market participants who would eventually exploit their market power. The central bank believes these are: The interlinking of domestic instant payment systems and future CBDCs, both with a competitive FX conversion layer, which may have the highest potential to deliver the holy grail for larger cross border payment corridors. All reviewed options require that progress is made in the field of AML/CFT compliance. The ECB says this will ensure straight-through-processing for the large majority of cross-border payments. The central bank raises the question whether financial authorities should develop both the interlinking of domestic payment systems and CBDCs, or dismiss one of them and “focus all efforts to implement the holy grail as soon as possible.” The European Central Bank has been working on a project to issue a digital version of the common European currency, the euro. Its investigation phase may take another year or so, President Christine Lagarde indicated last month. In an article co-authored with Board Member Fabio Panetta, she also marked key principles of the CBDC’s realization.

Grayscale Investments filed a “petition for review” Wednesday challenging the decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to deny the company’s application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale’s CEO, tweeted soon after the SEC rejected his company’s application: “We’ve filed a lawsuit against the SEC.”  Sonnenshein commented: “We are deeply disappointed by and vehemently disagree with the SEC’s decision to continue to deny spot Bitcoin ETFs from coming to the U.S. market.” He added: We believe American investors overwhelmingly voiced a desire to see GBTC convert to a spot bitcoin ETF, which would unlock billions of dollars of investor capital while bringing the world’s largest bitcoin fund further into the U.S. regulatory perimeter. Donald B.

All the major stock indexes rebounded after falling for nearly eight weeks in a row, while the crypto economy took some losses on Thursday, losing roughly 4% against the U.S. dollar during the past 24 hours. Meanwhile gold has been hanging below the $1,850 per ounce mark as Kitco’s Neils Christensen says gold markets remain “under pressure, seeing no major buying momentum.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, the Nasdaq, and NYSE composite all rallied during Thursday’s trading sessions. The S&P 500 rose about 2% reaching 4,057.84 by the closing bell, while Nasdaq spiked 2.7%, hitting 11,740.65. Markets check: It's a better day as stocks continued to rebound from the lowest levels in over a year. Nasdaq 100 is currently up 2.99% https://t.co/SvxNwDuX3N pic.twitter.com/gbsgAlPP8B — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) May 26, 2022  The Dow Jones jumped around 1.6% on Thursday afternoon, as the index recorded gains for the fifth straight day in a row. Quincy Krosby, LPL Financial’s chief equity strategist, believes the rebound may be a sign that some of last week’s doom and gloom predictions were overhyped. “Although this was an expected, and highly talked about potential ‘oversold’ rally, the underpinning for today’s market climb higher, suggests that last week’s doom and gloom about the all-important U.S. consumer may have been overdone, along with the dire recession headlines,” Krosby told CNBC’s Tanaya Macheel and Jesse Pound on Thursday. Meanwhile, amid the equities rebound, the cryptocurrency economy faltered again on Thursday, losing 4% during the past 24 hours of trading. Bitcoin (BTC) lost a small percentage on Thursday dropping roughly 0.7%. Ethereum (ETH), however, lost around 6.9%, alongside a number of alternative crypto assets that saw deeper losses than bitcoin. While stock markets have improved and crypto assets have not, a number of traders have been discussing crypto decoupling from stocks in terms of correlation. Crypto Twitter: crypto did not decouple! Nasdaq: +4% this week ETH: -3% this week (-13% open to trough) — Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) May 26, 2022  The economist and trader Alex Krüger spoke about crypto decoupling from stocks on Thursday. “Worst case scenario for crypto is here,” Krüger said. “Apathy and decoupling. The correlation with equities is now broken. It’s been largely gone since Monday afternoon. Now equities bounce alone.” After his statement, Krüger doubled down on his commentary. “Watch people who don’t trade and barely watch charts or correlations disagree with this tweet. It’s ok. Everybody copes differently,” Krüger added. The bitcoin proponent Luke Martin, host of the Stacks podcast, also talked about digital currencies not bouncing back with equities markets. “Seeing lots of tweets about stocks [and] crypto decoupling, and crypto not bouncing with stocks,” Martin tweeted. “Charting gives a better picture of what’s happening: 1/ We had high correlation 2/ Luna collapse leads to more severe crypto selloff 3/ Post collapse crypto not making up the difference.” Gold has also not increased in value and remains under the $1,850 per ounce price range against the U.S. dollar. 30-day statistics show an ounce of fine gold is down 1.67% and 0.27% was lost during the past 24 hours. On Thursday, Kitco’s Neils Christensen discussed gold’s slump in a report that highlights the recent U.S. Commerce Department report that notes the first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) declined at a 1.5% annual rate. “The gold market is not seeing much reaction to the disappointing economic data,” Christensen explained on Thursday. Gold bug and economist Peter Schiff talked about the GDP shrinking 1.5% and also mentioned that bitcoin (BTC) has decoupled from Nasdaq. “The U.S. economy, supposedly the strongest it’s ever been, contracted by 1.5% in Q1, .2% more than analysts expected,” Schiff said on Thursday. “If [the] GDP contracts again in Q2, then the economy is officially in a recession. If GDP contracts when the economy is so [strong], imagine what happens when it’s weak,” the economist added. Schiff continued on Thursday and made sure to throw salt on bitcoin’s recent market wounds. Schiff remarked: Is bitcoin finally breaking free of its high correlation with the Nasdaq? While tech stocks are rising today Bitcoin is falling, almost breaking below $28K. My guess is that Bitcoin will continue to maintain its positive correlation with the Nasdaq, but only when it’s falling. What do you think about the current state of markets and the economy?

It also tracks the investment performance of the Bloomberg Grayscale Future of Finance Index. “We announced our first ETF earlier this year in partnership with Bloomberg as part of the expansion of our business,” said Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein. “We’re thrilled to be expanding our offering in Europe through the UCITS wrapper.” Meanwhile, Grayscale is trying to convince the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve the conversion of its flagship product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), into a spot bitcoin ETF. GBTC currently has $19.2 billion in assets under management. The company recently had a private meeting with the SEC to discuss its application, according to CNBC. The asset manager told the regulator that turning its Bitcoin Trust product into a NYSE-traded ETF would broaden access to bitcoin and enhance protections while unlocking up to $8 billion in value for investors.

The bank serves around 54 million customers across Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia. The announcement details: The company launched today in Brazil an exclusive in-app crypto trading experience, offering initially bitcoin and ethereum trading starting at BRL $1.00 (~U.S. $0.20). The new service aims to enable “customers to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency all from the same [Nubank] app, with no need to open new accounts or transfer money,” the bank explained.

The bank noted that the new crypto trading service “will be gradually available for customers in Brazil starting in May 2022, reaching the entire customer base by the end of July 2022.” The announcement adds that “Nubank will do frequent curation” in order to offer more cryptocurrencies to clients. Furthermore, the bank will “provide educational resources to customers interested in digital currency transactions, to support informed investment decisions.” Nubank’s crypto trading is operated in partnership with Paxos, a regulated blockchain infrastructure provider that will act as a custody provider and broker, according to the announcement. Charles Cascarilla, co-founder and CEO of Paxos, commented: “Nubank’s move to enter the crypto trading space represents a strategic move not only for the company but for an acceleration of the cryptocurrency adoption in the region.” David Vélez, founder and CEO of Nubank, opined: There is no doubt that crypto is a growing trend in Latin America, one that we have been following closely and believe will have a transformational impact on the region. In addition to launching cryptocurrency trading, Nu Holdings, Nubank’s parent company, announced that it has allocated “~1% of its balance sheet cash to bitcoin.” The company stated: The transaction reinforces the company’s conviction in the current and future potential of bitcoin in the region’s financial services landscape.

For Fitch, bonds rated AAA, AA, A, or BBB are considered investment grade, while those rated BB, B, CCC, CC, C, or D are considered speculative, or junk grade, bonds. The company explained that CCC ratings mean “Substantial credit risk” with “Very low margin for safety,” and that “Default is a real possibility.” The rating agency explained: In Fitch’s view, weakening of institutions and concentration of power in the presidency have increased policy unpredictability, and the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender has added uncertainty about the potential for an IMF program that would unlock financing for 2022-2023. The rating agency also said that “heightened financing risks stemming from increased reliance on short-term debt” ahead of an $800 million global bond payment due next January influenced its decision to cut El Salvador’s rating.

Since then, Coinbase shares have dropped by close to half that value and today, COIN is swapping for more than 45% lower at $187 per unit. Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) is a popular crypto firm and digital asset exchange with 8.8 million monthly transacting users during its height in Q2 2021. The business founded by Fred Ehrsam and Brian Armstrong in 2012 officially went public on Nasdaq on April 14, 2021, via a direct listing. As the company heads into its tenth operational year, COIN shares have been trading for much less than the stock’s value on April 16 and November 12, 2021. When COIN first launched, the stock exchange Nasdaq decided on an initial $250 per share reference price. Two days later — and while bitcoin (BTC) reached $64K per unit — COIN tapped a high of $342 per share. The Coinbase stock dropped in value after that day, and dipped to a consolidated low of $242 during the months of May through September, with a few jumps to the $250-278 range during that time. The Nasdaq-traded stock follows alongside BTC’s fluctuations like many crypto-asset firms that have exposure to this new asset class. So when BTC ran up to another price high beyond $64K to an all-time high of $69K, COIN hit another $342 price high. The stock is now close to half the $342 price high, and is 45.16% lower in value, trading at $187 per share. Similar to BTC, the price is much lower than the ATH and in December COIN had a brief Holiday rally alongside the crypto economy’s passing comeback that month. In a recent blog post, the Boston-based data and analytics firm Trefis asked if the Coinbase stock was a good buy after such a sizeable correction. “The stock currently trades at just about 22x our projected 2021 earnings, which is not a particularly rich valuation for a highly profitable and futuristic stock with solid long-term earnings potential,” Trefis said on Wednesday. “For perspective, Coinbase’s net margins stood at an incredible 57% over the first three quarters of 2021.” The data and analytics firm added: However, the cryptocurrency market is inherently cyclical, and the odds are that we could be approaching a market peak given the Fed’s stance on interest rates.

The company’s unaudited balance sheet shows net digital assets of $1.26 billion at the end of December last year. This amount is unchanged from the third quarter. Tesla’s unaudited statement of cash flows also shows that there was no purchase or sale of digital assets in the last three quarters. The only cryptocurrency purchase Tesla made was bitcoin in the first quarter in the amount of $1.5 billion. The only sale the company made was also in the first quarter. While Tesla never disclosed how much bitcoin it owns, Musk previously hinted that it is close to 42K BTC. The electric car company started accepting bitcoin for payments in March 2021. However, the company halted accepting the crypto in May citing environmental issues. Musk subsequently said that Tesla will resume accepting BTC when bitcoin miners can confirm clean energy usage. “When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions,” he said. However, Tesla still has not resumed accepting bitcoin. Meanwhile, Tesla is now accepting the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE) for some merchandise. Musk, also known in the crypto community as the Dogefather, has been a longtime supporter of dogecoin. He recently tried to tempt McDonald’s to accept DOGE by offering to eat a happy meal on television if the fast-food chain accepts the meme coin.

After the Proshares bitcoin ETF BITO reached an all-time high on November 10, the ETF is down 39% over the last 64 days. Valkyrie’s bitcoin ETF has also shed 37% in value over the last two months. A large portion of the cryptocurrency community was very hyped up for years about the launch of the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), as a number of bitcoin ETF applications were denied prior to 2021. Finally, when the first U.S. bitcoin futures ETF was approved, the debut of Proshare’s bitcoin futures ETF smashed records, capturing close to $1 billion in total volume during the first 24 hours. Months later, the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) is exchanging hands for $26.96 on January 13, 2022, but that price is 39.12% lower than the 44.29 high on November 10, 2021.  Bloomberg author Katherine Greifeld explained in mid-November that the “bitcoin futures ETF frenzy is fading.” “While the Proshares fund absorbed $1.1 billion in just two days — the quickest an ETF has ever done so — that pace of growth has cooled considerably,” Greifeld said at the time. The financial author further discussed the Vaneck ETF, as she noted that lower management fees could differentiate the fund from the rest. At the time, Greifeld quoted Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, who said: There’s definitely a lull going on right now relative to the launch mania and so Vaneck has their work cut out for them in trying to get people excited again. The same can be said for the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF) when it reached an all-time high (ATH) of $26.67 per share on November 9, 2021, and today it’s changing hands for $16.70 per unit or 37.38% down from the ATH.  The Vaneck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) is only down 27.70%, as the ETF exchanged hands for $58.08 per unit on November 19, 2021, and today it’s trading for 41.99 per unit. While Proshares and the Valkyrie ETFs debuted well before Vaneck’s offering, all of the funds have a strong relationship with spot price of bitcoin and the crypto asset’s futures markets.  Futures markets have seen a decline in open interest, as total bitcoin futures open interest across cryptocurrency exchanges has declined since mid-November as well. The highest number of bitcoin futures open interest was on November 11, 2021, with over $28 billion. Today, the aggregate open interest across the most popular derivatives exchanges is $17.22 billion. That equates to a loss of 38.50% over the last two months and the pattern is quite similar to bitcoin’s (BTC) spot market price action.

Hayes states that eventually, the U.S. will be forced to act by printing money and exchanging it for yens. Bitcoin is becoming a global asset whose price is beginning to be affected by geopolitical and economic dynamics. Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of Bitmex and current Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of Maelstrom, has predicted that any action taken to correct the current weak yen situation would lead to the debasement of the U.S. dollar and consequently to the appreciation of bitcoin. In his latest newsletter, “The Easy Button,” Hayes states that the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yuan is the “most important global economic variable,” as its current instability will eventually guarantee an action from the Federal Reserve. A too-weak yen will cause action from China, which will try to devalue its currency to maintain its competitiveness with Japanese products. In the same way, a weakening of the Chinese yuan will also create a difficult situation for the U.S. industrial complex, that will continue to push manufacturing abroad. This is why Hayes stressed that the Federal Reserve might take the easy route and avoid the pitfalls associated with this scenario by just swapping freshly printed dollars for yens, allowing the Bank of Japan to unleash these trillion to intervene in the FX market. Also, this creates the conditions for China to continue printing yuans and increase its monetary expansion without creating imbalances in its economy. However, if done wrongly, this risks ending the dollar hegemony as a reserve currency, given that it will lose a high percentage of its value against other fiat currencies and Bitcoin. Hayes assessed that if his theory is correct, “it is trivial for any institutional investor to buy one of the US-listed Bitcoin ETFs,” declaring bitcoin as the “best-performing asset in the face of global fiat debasement.” “When something is done about the weak yen, I will mathematically guestimate how flows into the Bitcoin complex will ratchet the price to $1 million and possibly beyond,” he concluded.

According to reports, the institution demands changes to El Salvador’s Bitcoin law to receive a $1.4 billion credit line for expediting public debt payments and other obligations. Bitcoin has become a relevant geoeconomic factor for El Salvador, as it is currently part of the talks between the country’s government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). According to reports, the negotiations between these parties would be at a standstill, as the IMF demands changes in the country’s posture on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Talks had been suspended since two years ago when President Nayib Bukele did not agree to review the Bitcoin Law, which established bitcoin as legal tender in the country in 2021. Bukele’s government would be aiming to score a credit line for $1.4 billion to help expedite debt payments and other obligations. Nonetheless, the IMF has sent clear messages on this issue: IMF Director of Comms Julie Kozack stated that the risks associated with Bitcoin were a “key element” in the discussions with Salvadoran authorities. However, even when the institution has expressed its worries about bitcoin to Salvadoran authorities, Bukele has doubled down on his crypto policies since he was reelected in February. In March, Bukele stated that the country would keep buying 1 BTC per day until it becomes unaffordable with fiat currencies. Other funding alternatives based on Bitcoin, like the Volcano bonds announced in November 2021, have been delayed several times. This idea might have been rehashed, as reports indicate that Bukele is seeking fresh funding by issuing a similar instrument targeting the U.S. banking sector, leveraged on bitcoin’s recovered prices.

It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries. Kiyosaki wrote on social media platform X Friday: “Boomers to go bust? Another giant bank in China went bust. Why? This time it’s commercial real estate, not residential going bust. FYI. China has the three biggest banks in the world.” He cautioned: “The same is happening in U.S. as commercial real estate, specifically office buildings go bust.” He then explained how the commercial real estate market affects baby boomers, stating: “REITS: Real Estate Investment Trusts….a.k.a. Mutual fund ETFs [exchange-traded funds] for real estate. Boomer retirement plans are filled with these fake assets.” The renowned author cautioned: Boomers retirements are going broke as paper assets crash. Regardless of your age it’s time to get out of fake assets, including fiat, dollars and buy real gold, silver, and real bitcoins. I do not trust anything that can be printed. The Chinese property sector is experiencing a crisis that began with Evergrande Group’s default in 2021, leading to financial troubles for other major developers. A Hong Kong court ordered Evergrande’s liquidation in January. China’s minister of housing and urban-rural development stated earlier this month that insolvent companies should go bankrupt or be restructured according to the law and market principles. Kiyosaki is a vocal critic of fiat currencies, calling them “fake money” and likening them to “giant Ponzi schemes.” In contrast, he views gold and silver as “God’s money” and sees bitcoin as “people’s money.” He recently stated that bitcoin is a “perfect asset at the right time.” The acclaimed author predicts a BTC surge to $100,000 by September, fueled by the upcoming halving in April. He also believes that BTC is headed for $300K this year. Kiyosaki doubled down on his bitcoin optimism this month, urging investors to buy as much BTC as they can afford before the biggest bubble in history bursts, wiping out baby boomers’ retirement plans.

The executive explained that the U.S. debt crisis makes it “so easy to convince people to buy bitcoin and other hard assets.” He emphasized that implementing these measures could give the U.S. a chance to avoid a “debt death spiral.” Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz took to social media platform X on Wednesday to warn about the growing U.S. national debt. He also outlined a series of proposals aimed at tackling this fiscal challenge. “What no one wants to hear is that we need to cut government spending pretty drastically,” he began. “We also need to raise taxes on the wealthy some. We also need close loopholes.” The Galaxy Digital CEO stressed: “If we do all this, we ‘might’ have a chance to not have a debt death spiral. Right now it’s $34 trillion. $1 trillion every 100 days. 35, 36, 37…..” The executive added: It’s why it is so easy to convince people to buy BTC and other hard assets. Novogratz is a strong bitcoin advocate. He recently predicted that BTC will reach $100K this year and that the cryptocurrency will not fall below $55K again. He noted that there is currently “runaway momentum” in spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and “tremendous global demand for bitcoin.” As warnings about the U.S. debt crisis mount, some investors are exploring bitcoin as a potential hedge. In October 2021, Senator Cynthia Lummis praised bitcoin during her speech on the Senate floor as she raised concerns regarding the rising national debt. She has been a bitcoin holder since 2013, seeing the cryptocurrency as a great store of value. Blackrock CEO Larry Fink said in January that he is now a big believer in bitcoin, noting: “If you’re in a country where you’re fearful of your future, fearful of your government, or you’re frightened that your government is devaluing its currency by too much deficits, you can say this is a great potential long-term store of value. Like I said, it’s like digital gold.” Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has repeatedly warned about the ballooning U.S. national debt, urging investors to buy bitcoin alongside gold and silver.

Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz argued that the only thing that can undermine the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency is reckless spending by both U.S. political parties. Meanwhile, Elon Musk slammed the U.S. government for using the dollar as a political tool, stating: “We have overplayed our hand in weaponizing the dollar. It was a dumb move.” A video featuring former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 2019 comments about cryptocurrency resurfaced on social media platform X over the weekend, sparking renewed debate within the crypto community. Despite being from a November 2019 panel discussion, the video prompted responses and criticisms from many in the crypto space. Clinton said: “One more area that I hope nation-states start paying greater attention to is the rise of cryptocurrency — because what looks like a very interesting, and somewhat exotic effort to literally mine new coins in order to trade with them, has the potential for undermining currencies, for undermining the role of the dollar as the reserve currency, for destabilizing nations, perhaps starting with small ones but going much larger.” Responding to Clinton alleging that bitcoin has the potential to undermine the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz wrote on X Saturday: The only thing that can undermine the $ as a reserve currency is reckless spending by BOTH parties. Trump and Biden have normalized huge deficits and have put us into the worst fiscal crisis of my lifetime. Don’t blame BTC. It is a report card on fiscal responsibility. Lawyer John E. Deaton commented: “The incumbents who’ve been in power for decades are threatened by anything they can’t control. Bitcoin is an asset. Period. In America, people have the right to own assets. The fact that these politicians, who believe in the government telling people what they can own and how they should live, are scared of bitcoin is the best advertisement to own it. God forbid regular people have access to the number one appreciating asset of all time.” Brian Morgenstern, head of Public Policy at Riot Platforms, also responded to Clinton’s warning: “No, $2T deficits undermine the dollar. The government spending 38% more than it collects causes dollar debasement. On the other hand, BTC and other commodities could strengthen the dollar by tying it to global asset values and creating cross-border efficiencies.” Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin also discussed the U.S. dollar losing its dominance. He claimed that the U.S. is killing the dollar with its own hands by using the currency as a political tool.

Additionally, Rogers discussed the leading crypto asset bitcoin, emphasizing his skepticism towards cryptocurrencies evolving into actual money. He underscored that should they pose a real challenge to traditional fiat currencies, governments will not tolerate it. On Feb. 1, 2024, Jim Rogers engaged in an interview with Michelle Makori, the lead anchor and chief editor at Kitco News, delving into discussions on the U.S. economy, particular investment strategies, and briefly addressing bitcoin (BTC). Rogers shared with Makori his anticipation of a market slump, despite U.S. equities reaching peak levels unprecedented in recent years. He firmly believes the forthcoming decline will surpass any he has witnessed throughout his life. “In 2008, we had a big problem, but the debt everywhere has skyrocketed since then,” Roger said. “So the next recession has to be the worst in my lifetime because the debt is so much higher now than it has ever been before in my lifetime. Even China has a lot of debt now.” Rogers explained to Makori that the greenback has recently been in disarray, with many still viewing cash, particularly U.S. dollars, as a refuge. He further stressed: The U.S. dollar is not a sound currency anymore. We’re the largest debtor nation in the history of the world. But everybody thinks it’s a sound currency, and they think it’s a safe haven. So when problems come, people race to a safe haven. In the second part of their conversation, Makori queried Rogers on his views regarding bitcoin, especially after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green-lit a significant number of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), recalling his earlier assertion that governments would ban bitcoin. “Well … my point just to clarify, is that I don’t see cryptocurrencies becoming money because the governments do not want that competition,” Rogers emphasized. The business mogul added: I don’t think it’s a legitimate currency anywhere, except maybe in El Salvador, but El Salvador only has six million people, so I don’t think that’s going to change the world. I don’t own any cryptocurrencies. I never have, I’m not short any, I’ve never been short any [cryptocurrencies]. I mean I wish I’d bought it when it was a dollar, I wish I’d bought IBM in 1914, I wish a lot of things you know, looking back in history. However, Rogers maintained that should crypto assets pose real threats to governments, they will not stand for it. “That’s not the way Washington or London or other places work,” Rogers quipped. To date, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) do not pose a “threat” to state-issued currency, in Rogers’ view, being merely a “trading vehicle.” As Rogers’ interview concluded, Makori inquired about his stance on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), to which he emphasized that governments, naturally, are very fond of the concept. “I fully expect that eventually, currencies are going to be on the computer,” Rogers explained. “It’s much more efficient, it’s cheaper, it’s better for many people, and governments love it because as you point out they know everything you do. They’ll call you up one day and say ‘Michelle you’ve been drinking too much coffee this month, don’t drink so much coffee anymore … They’ll know everything you do, they’ll know everything we do, governments love that, I don’t particularly like it, I think it’s horrible. But governments have the guns. I don’t have any guns. So they will do what they want and I suspect and it should happen that currency money will be on the computer someday.” The chairman of Rogers Holdings continued: It’s not good for you and me, but it’s certainly good for the governments.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) additionally stated that the committee “does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation” is steadily approaching the 2% mark. As benchmark equity indices experienced declines, the price of bitcoin remained unaffected. The U.S. central bank has resolved to maintain the federal funds rate between 5.25% and 5.5% until the forthcoming FOMC meeting. The Fed observed that recent signs indicate a robust expansion of economic activity. It acknowledged that while job growth has slowed compared to the early part of last year, it continues to be strong, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Although inflation has moderated over the previous year, it continues to be higher than desired. “In support of its goals, the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent,” the central bank disclosed on Wednesday. “In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.” The Fed added: The committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. The three primary indices tracking market performance in the United States — the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor’s 500, and the Nasdaq Composite — all registered declines following the announcement. In contrast, bitcoin (BTC) remained steady, holding its value at $43,258 per unit on Wednesday afternoon after the FOMC announcement. #Powell spoke about “goods inflation” and “housing inflation.” There’s no such thing as either. Prices don’t inflate, they rise as a result of inflation. Economic growth actually pushes prices down. It’s #inflation that pushes them up. All inflation is caused by the #Fed & Govt. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 31, 2024 \\nGold and silver also remained stable in the wake of the Fed’s decision on interest rates. Although bitcoin and precious metals markets showed no significant movement, the banking sector experienced turbulence. Shares of New York Community Bancorp (NYSB) plummeted over 40% on Wednesday, impacting a broad spectrum of banking stocks. During the subsequent press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell mentioned that the FOMC requires additional data and “greater confidence” regarding the reduction of inflation. This move positions the central bank to potentially reduce the federal funds rate within this year. “I want to assure the American people we are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2% goal,” Powell informed the media. He added: The lower inflation readings over the second half of last year are welcome, but we will need to see continuing evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably to our goal. By 3:45 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on Wednesday, bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped 2.1% under the $43K threshold to $42,796 per unit. “I will tell you that I don’t think it’s likely that the committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March is the time to do [rate cuts],” Powell told the press. Markets expressed disappointment with Powell’s statement, as there’s widespread anticipation of rate cuts in March 2024. What do you think about the Fed’s decision to keep rates the same?

This move resulted in the purchase of $15.9 million worth of shares in ARKB. Following this transaction, ARKB shares closed at $43.51 on Tuesday, marking a 0.80% decrease. Prior to the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., ARKW had made futures-based cryptocurrency investments. ARKW had initially acquired 20,000 shares of the ARK 21shares Active Bitcoin Futures Strategy ETF (ARKA) and 4.32 million shares of BITO. The BITO shares were paid for by completely liquidating its holdings in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). This move was interpreted by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas as a “temporary parking spot,” a strategy often employed by Ark Invest and other institutions during transitional phases using highly liquid ETFs. In addition to these strategic shifts within the cryptocurrency domain, Ark Invest has also been adjusting its broader portfolio. The firm has been offloading holdings in Coinbase (COIN) to diversify into other investments, including Tesla (TSLA).

Kiyosaki expressed his frustration on social media platform X on Friday that the national debt has ballooned by another trillion dollars since the National Football League (NFL) season began. “Please buy gold, silver, and bitcoin,” he stressed, urging investors to shield themselves from the financial corruption and incompetence of our leaders. The national debt currently stands at $34.06 trillion, a $1.02 trillion increase since Sept. 18 last year, according to the Treasury Department.  Besides Kiyosaki, many others have sounded the alarm about the U.S. national debt. Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff explained on Jan. 2 on X: “It’s only the 2nd day of Jan. and the national debt already blew past $34 trillion. I think 2024 will set a record for the largest one-year increase in the U.S. national debt in history. The only question is will there be a sovereign debt or dollar crisis before the year ends.” Schiff added: It took less than three months and two weeks to add the last trillion to the national debt. I think the U.S. will add the next trillion in less than three months. At that pace, the national debt will be growing at over $1 trillion per quarter. Just imagine if there’s a recession! In November last year, Moody’s downgraded the U.S. credit rating to “negative,” citing growing deficits and debt burdens. Echoing these concerns, U.S. Senator Rand Paul warned that out-of-control government spending jeopardizes the very existence of the dollar, stating: “The greatest threat to [our national security] is the national debt. We borrowed a trillion dollars in the last three months.” Renowned billionaire “Bond King” Jeffrey Gundlach also sounded the alarm in October last year, cautioning: “The massive budget deficit and increasing interest rates on the national debt should scare every American … The future of the U.S. dollar, and possibly out-of-control inflation, depends on getting the budget and spending under control.” Do you share Robert Kiyosaki’s concerns regarding the rapid rise of the U.S. national debt?

At the All-in podcast, Palihapitiya explained: I think this is the most important year for Bitcoin that has ever existed we are probably days away from a series of ETFs being approved and so this is the moment for Bitcoin to use that old term ‘cross the chasm’ and really see mainstream adoption.

Buy gold, silver, & bitcoin and be a winner not a loser.” Kiyosaki has been recommending gold, silver, and bitcoin for quite some time. He previously said that the three investments are the best for “unstable times.” He believes that they provide “lifelong financial security and freedom.” In April, Kiyosaki said “America is dying,” warning of the demise of the U.S. dollar. The famous author is not alone in expressing concerns about hyperinflation. Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey predicted in 2021 that hyperinflation will soon happen in the U.S. and the world. Venture capitalist Balaji Srinivasan said in March that hyperinflation is happening now. Economist Peter Schiff has also sounded the alarm on the matter, stating last year that major Fed rate hikes risk hyperinflation.

Hayes highlighted the complexity and rise of bond yields and the role of bitcoin as a fiscal counterbalance. On Thursday, Arthur Hayes explained the precarious balance the Treasury’s Janet Yellen must strike in managing U.S. fiscal health amid rising government deficits. Hayes describes Yellen’s strategic options, including liquidity injections and manipulating Federal Reserve rate expectations, to manage economic growth and government funding. “Inject liquidity into the system so that stocks rise. When stocks pump, capital gains taxes rise, which helps pay some bills,” Hayes detailed in his latest missive called “Bad Gurl.” Hayes speaks to the rising yields on long-term U.S. debt and the market’s negative response to Treasury strategies. He presents the “bear steepener” scenario as a challenge to financial stability, explaining, “Yields on long-end treasury debt are rising faster than short-end yields,” which could undermine banking solvency. Hayes’ previous work, “The Periphery,” delves into why this steepening is particularly toxic for the banking system. In his analysis, Hayes points out the global reverberations of U.S. monetary policy, suggesting that other central banks will engage in similar quantitative easing tactics. “All other major central banks … will also print money,” he asserts, viewing it as an inevitable response to the Fed’s easing, creating a global ripple of fiscal expansion that may redefine the international monetary balance. For investors, Hayes recommends shunning long-term bonds in favor of more liquid and short-term investments. He suggests that the RRP (Reverse Repo Program) balance is key to understanding the immediate investment landscape. A trillion-dollar liquidity injection will power a rising U.S. stock market, Hayes predicts, advocating for a diversified approach to asset allocation amid these shifts. Diving into cryptocurrency, Hayes champions bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) as foundational assets within the digital currency sphere, outperforming traditional investment vehicles amidst central bank balance expansions. “Bitcoin and ether are crypto’s reserve assets,” he states, asserting their dominance over “sh**coins” and other altcoins in terms of development, application activity, and locked value. Hayes forecasts that the RRP’s reduction will inject liquidity into global markets, strengthening crypto’s position. He outlines a potential scenario where dollar liquidity swells, Treasury bill sales surge, and Bitcoin investment trends sharpen. “The RRP drawdown is a goal,” Hayes notes, marking it as a pivotal indicator for future fiscal and monetary policy decisions. Emphasizing big tech’s resilience and growth potential, Hayes highlights companies with ties to artificial intelligence (AI) as smart investments in a liquidity-rich economy. “AI is the future,” he asserts, linking technological advancement to economic growth and suggesting that investments in AI could see significant returns as cash becomes “trash” once more. Hayes says the “smartest trade is going long crypto.” The former Bitmex CEO added: There is nothing else that has outperformed the increase in central bank balances sheets like crypto. The first stop is always bitcoin. Bitcoin is money and only money. The next stop is ether. Ether is the commodity that powers the Ethereum network which is the best internet computer. Asserting bitcoin’s resilience, Hayes contrasts its performance with traditional assets during economic or geopolitical strife. He reflects on bitcoin’s robust response to market unrest, suggesting that it remains a wise investment despite potential short-term sell-offs. “Bitcoin has proven to outperform bonds during times of war,” Hayes remarks, reaffirming his confidence in the leading crypto asset as a hedge against inflation and instability.

In a Thursday interview with Gareth Soloway, the head market strategist at inthemoneystocks.com, the expert delved into the potential longevity of this rally. Soloway also touched upon the upcoming gathering of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the ascent of 10-year treasury yields to a pinnacle unmatched in the last 16 years. On a Thursday marked by a downturn in U.S. equities, resulting in a sea of red across the stock market, precious metals, and the crypto markets stood resilient, weathering the storm with grace. Gareth Soloway, the chief market strategist at inthemoneystocks.com, engaged in a thorough discussion about the U.S. and global economies with Michelle Makori, the leading anchor and editor-in-chief at Kitco News. During their exchange, Soloway pinpointed the Federal Reserve as the market’s current focal point, speculating on whether the central bank will opt to increase the federal funds rate. He underscored the noteworthy development of the 10-year treasury yields surging past 5% for the first time in a span of 16 years. Emphasizing the significance, Soloway remarked that a 5% yield on the 10-year treasury “is very, very important to the psychology of the market.” Echoing Bill Gross’ prediction, he anticipates a recession could unfold by the year’s fourth quarter, highlighting a stark contrast in consumer confidence across different income brackets. Soloway observed, “I think you look at the economy right now and you could argue that half the population has already been in a recession.” He also speculated on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for the following week, suggesting the Fed might opt to halt its rate hikes, given the evident market stress. “They see the stress that’s gone on in the markets,” the analyst added. Shifting the focus to bitcoin (BTC), Soloway speculated on the potential approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), cautioning that it might trigger a substantial sell-off. While acknowledging bitcoin’s impressive performance, he questioned its resilience against a possible 15-20% asset sell-off in the Nasdaq, expressing concern that a 35% plunge in the stock market could eventually instill fear and panic among bitcoin holders. Soloway declared: You’ll probably get [an ETF] approval by year-end or early in 2024. If bitcoin is still up here, you may not go higher. It may be already factoring in the approval. It’s very possible it could be a sell on the news. Looking ahead, Soloway pondered the future narratives that could propel bitcoin’s price post-ETF approval. He acknowledged the growing acceptance of BTC as a legitimate asset class by “big money,” paralleling it with gold. In the event of tumultuous times ahead for stock markets, he envisions a surge in demand for bitcoin, predicting that the next resistance during this run-up might hover around $47,000 per unit. “Many of these ETF institutions have probably been accumulating for the last couple of months, knowing that eventually an approval will come. And so, there may not be as many buyers for the spot ETF,” Soloway said. Nevertheless, it’s within the realm of possibility that BTC might plummet to the $15,000 bracket, especially if the stock markets take a nosedive and widespread panic ensues. “Panic is panic; it’s the biggest emotion we have, it’s the most intense, and if we did have that scenario, you could still see bitcoin dip,” Soloway confided in Makori. In addition to monitoring bitcoin, Soloway has set his sights on gold, expressing optimism about its potential to surge by the close of this year or in 2024. He asserted, “We’re talking at least the potential for $2,400 to $2,500 gold in 2024,” wrapping up the analysis with his gold forecast. What do you think about Soloway’s predictions?

When asked about what needs to happen in Mexico for mass bitcoin adoption, Salinas replied: “The first thing that needs to happen is people need to realize that they’re being scammed, that they are being robbed by these crooks and the government.” He stressed: “That’s what they are, they’re fraudsters. They commit fraud and they stand there and say ‘how are we doing monetary policy’ and they’re just stealing people blind.” The billionaire emphasized: “So first thing that needs to happen is people need to understand how this works so they can then defend against that but these ‘gobiernicolas,’ these government cavemen as I call them, they’re not dumb and they’re not stupid and they’re not going to give away this power they have to confiscate people’s wealth, so you gotta take it from them.” He opined: I think everybody would benefit from understanding that the debasement of currency is a very useful trick in the fraudsters’ trick book to avoid raising taxes or debt. Regarding how a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will affect BTC, he said: “Obviously, an ETF is a new source of demand. It makes it easier for people to invest in bitcoin so that’s great. It’s what’s needed. But precisely because it’s great and what’s needed, it’s precisely because of that reason that the crooks in power don’t allow it to proceed.” He noted that the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, “knows exactly what we’re talking about.” The billionaire concluded: He [Gensler] has very good reasons not to allow, as well as the people in the Treasury and the Fed, they all know perfectly well it’s not about protecting investors, it’s about protecting their way of financing government spending without raising taxes.

Jefferies is a leading global, full-service investment banking and capital markets firm headquartered in the U.S. The firm operates across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific. In a note to investors published Wednesday, Chris Wood, Global Head of Equity Strategy at Jefferies, called bitcoin and gold “critical hedges” against currency debasement and diminishing returns from inflation. Wood has received several recognitions, including Best Strategist in 2020 in the Asia region by Asiamoney. Wood explained that in addition to reducing its balance sheet, the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates at an unprecedented pace in its efforts to tame soaring inflation. He believes that the Fed may be forced to abruptly adopt a dovish stance in the face of a U.S. recession as the central bank grapples with a $33 trillion U.S. “debt death spiral.” The Jefferies analyst warned: “G7 central banks, including most importantly the Federal Reserve, will not be able to exit from unconventional monetary policy in a benign manner and will ultimately remain committed to ongoing central bank balance-sheet expansion in one form or another.” He emphasized: Such a failure to exit from unorthodox monetary policy in a benign manner is likely to culminate in the collapse of the U.S.-dollar paper standard to the benefit of both gold bullion owners and also owners of bitcoin. Wood advised investors to regard their gold and bitcoin holdings as a type of insurance, rather than short-term trades. Additionally, he recommends that U.S. dollar-based long-term global investors, including pension funds, allocate 10% of their portfolios to BTC. The analyst further described: Bitcoin has now become investible for institutions, with custodian arrangements in place for digital assets, and represents an alternative store of value to gold.

Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years.

He proceeded to urge investors to start saving gold, silver, bitcoin, and cash now before it is too late.  The renowned author is not the only one who is concerned about the Federal Reserve launching a central bank digital currency. Last week, the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services passed the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act with the support of 60 Congress members. “This bill is simple: It halts the efforts of this Administrative State under President Biden from issuing a financial surveillance tool that will undermine the American way of life,” explained Congressman Tom Emmer (R-MN) who introduced the bill. In March, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz similarly introduced legislation to prohibit the Fed from developing a direct-to-consumer CBDC. However, the Fed is a long way from issuing a CBDC. In September last year, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressed that the central bank has not reached a decision on whether to issue a digital dollar. “We have not decided to proceed and we don’t see ourselves making that decision for some time,” he noted. “We see this as a process of at least a couple of years where we are doing work and building public confidence in our analysis and in our ultimate conclusion.” Do you agree with Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki regarding the Fed’s central bank digital currency and bitcoin becoming priceless?

The Cointime Economics white paper explains that coinblocks are the product of the number of bitcoin, or BTC, multiplied by the number of blocks they are held without moving. For instance, ten bitcoins held for ten blocks would equal 100 coinblocks. This method aims to capture the real economic weight and importance of each bitcoin based on the time it remains dormant. The longer a bitcoin is unmoved, the higher its cointime and implied economic significance.  Cointime Economics introduces metrics such as coinblocks created, destroyed, and stored to describe Bitcoin’s economic state over time. It also proposes ratios such as “liveliness,” which measures network activity, and “vaultedness,” which gauges inactiveness. When applied to bitcoin supply, this framework distinguishes between active supply and vaulted supply to assess true inflation and other factors. According to the researchers, Cointime Economics can enhance existing valuation models like the Market Value to Realized Value, or MVRV ratio by substituting active value and investor value for the traditional market cap and realized cap. They present a modified Active Value to Investor Value, or AVIV, ratio using cointime concepts that might more accurately indicate when BTC is overvalued or undervalued. The framework also enables new onchain analytics to measure Bitcoin’s volume- and time-weighted cost basis. As an example, the white paper introduces “Cointime Price” as a metric weighing both transaction volume and length of ownership. On May 7, 2023, the Cointime Price was $17,568, considerably below BTC’s market price.         \\nOverall, the researchers believe Cointime Economics offers a consistent way to quantify Bitcoin’s economic activity and importance that takes into account the time coins are stored. They argue metrics based on coinblocks and cointime might provide significant advantages over models relying only on traditional UTXOs and blockchain data.\\nAuthors James Check, the lead analyst at Glassnode, and co-author David Puell, a research associate at Ark Invest, noted that the introduction of this new conceptual framework aims to give analysts more robust tools for evaluating Bitcoin’s onchain fundamentals.\\nWhat do you think about Cointime Economics?

He added that savers who hold the U.S. dollar, which he called “fake” money, will be in serious trouble, noting that the U.S. national debt is “too high.” Kiyosaki often said that gold, silver, and bitcoin are his preferred investments, emphasizing that they are the best for unstable times. Following his warning about a global recession, he cautioned in May that the world economy is on the verge of collapse. The renowned author predicted in February that the price of bitcoin will hit $500,000 by 2025 while gold will soar to $5K and silver will hit $500 during that time period.

Srinivasan also advised investors to buy bitcoin, which he believes to be “a hedge against hyperinflation, monetary debasement, bank freezes, and wealth seizure.” Venture capitalist Balaji Srinivasan believes that hyperinflation is happening now. Srinivasan is an angel investor, tech founder, and a Wall Street Journal bestselling author. He formerly served as the CTO of crypto exchange Coinbase and was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (A16z). Commenting on a tweet made by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in October 2021 stating that hyperinflation will happen “soon” and will “change everything,” Srinivasan tweeted Friday, “Jack is right.” He emphasized: Hyperinflation is happening — now. The angel investor referenced recent government and Federal Reserve bailouts of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The Treasury Department said last Sunday that it will make available up to $25 billion as a backstop for its new Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). He further pointed out that Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari previously said: “There is an infinite amount of cash at the Federal Reserve.” Srinivasan explained in December last year that bitcoin is “a hedge against hyperinflation, monetary debasement, bank freezes, and wealth seizure.” He added: “It’s already proven itself in that role, in places like Venezuela, Lebanon, Nigeria.” In comparison, he explained that the largest cryptocurrency “may eventually have a gold-like role” as a hedge against “standard” inflation, but stressed that it “takes decades to show.” Believing that hyperinflation is already here, Srinivasan also urged investors to buy BTC in his tweet Friday. The venture capitalist wrote: Buy bitcoin and get your coins off exchanges. In addition, Srinivasan took a bet initiated by James Medlock, who announced on Twitter Thursday: “I’ll bet anyone $1 million dollars that the U.S. does not enter hyperinflation.” The former Coinbase CTO responded: I will take that bet. You buy 1 BTC. I will send $1M USD. This is ~40:1 odds as 1 BTC is worth ~$26k. The term is 90 days. All we need is a mutually agreed custodian who will still be there to settle this in the event of digital dollar devaluation. In a follow-up tweet, Srinivasan detailed: “I am moving $2M into USDC for the bet. I will do it with Medlock and one other person, sufficient to prove the point … Everyone else should just go buy bitcoin, as it’ll be much cheaper for you than locking one up for 90 days.” Several people have offered to help Medlock put up the 1 bitcoin for the bet. Medlock subsequently tweeted: “Balajis ready to do this?” Srinivasan responded: “Yes. Just moving money for the bet. We can do it via smart contract, but for simplicity old-fashioned escrow may work,” Srinivasan replied. “The escrow person would need one BTC address and one ETH address (for the USDC). The assets would sit on chain for 90 days.” He clarified: If BTC < $1M in 90 days after escrow, then you win and get both the 1 BTC and the $1M USDC. If BTC > $1M USD in 90 days after escrow, then I win and get both the 1 BTC and the (now worthless) $1M USDC. Medlock replied: “Sir, I believe we have ourselves a deal.” The CEO of crypto exchange Binance, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), joined the conversation, offering to be the escrow for the bet.

Earlier this month, he cautioned that the world economy is on the verge of collapse, warning of bank runs, frozen savings, and bail-ins. Prior to the shutdown of Signature Bank, he predicted that another bank was set to crash.

However, Harry Dent, founder of HS Dent Investment Management, believes that this trend may not continue in the near future. Dent predicts that gold may lose value to the range of $900 to $1,000 over the next 18 months. On Tuesday, Harry Dent, founder of HS Dent and financial author, spoke with Michelle Makori, the lead anchor and editor-in-chief at Kitco News. Dent expressed his belief that “the biggest crash in our lifetime” is approaching and that gold will be one of the year’s hardest-hit commodities. This perspective differs from that of many “gold bugs” who believe 2023 will be a positive year for the yellow metal. This week, economist and gold advocate Peter Schiff stated that gold’s rise in value is due to its perception as “a hedge against inflation and a weaker dollar.” Historically, gold has been viewed as a reliable store of value and a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Similarly, Jim Cramer, host of CNBC’s Mad Money program, emphasized that those who truly wish to protect against “inflation or economic chaos,” should “stick with gold.” Dent strongly disagrees with these perspectives and predicts that gold will lose significant value over the next 18 months. “Gold is not a safe haven,” Dent stated during his interview with Makori. “I’m predicting that gold goes down to $900 to $1,000. That will be a lot less than other commodities … that is still a 40 to 45 percent fall from here,” he added. Dent has previously identified several manufactured financial bubbles over the years and referred to the current situation as the “everything bubble.” While Dent believes 2023 may be challenging, he anticipates that mid-2024 will be even worse. “I feel like the ultimate low at this point for stocks is likely to be … July or so of 2024,” Dent said during the interview, noting that the tech-heavy Nasdaq index (IXIC) could reach 10,088 again. “So, we’re still in the early stages. To know that this crash is continuing and will go a lot deeper, we need to break the last low … which is 10,088.” The financial author added: The boom from 2009 to late 2021 in stocks was 120 percent artificial. It was just [the U.S. central bank] stimulating more and more to keep the stock market going up … That is taking a toxic financial drug, which when it finally goes down and fails, you have a hangup. Dent presumes that we are beginning the next wave of decline after a period of lateral movement. “This bubble has finally burst, it has started to burst,” Dent asserted to the Kitco anchor. “Now a bubble of this magnitude, like 1929 or 1972, which was not a bubble but it was a long-term [downturn]. It takes two-and-a-half to three years for a whole crash to happen. All we’ve seen so far, and we have seen it, is the first crash,” Dent added. In terms of bitcoin (BTC), Dent believes it will be the hardest hit among all assets and stocks.         \\nThe HS Dent executive expects bitcoin to crash to the $3,250 range, reaching the same low as it did during the Covid-19 crash in March 2020. “I think it goes down to $3,250, and then it starts a longer-term boom,” Dent opined. The investor views cryptocurrency as the next big thing and believes it has the potential to lead to the digitization of all aspects of finance and money. “There’s $600 trillion dollars” in financial assets, Dent detailed, and digitizing that and expanding trade to make it more efficient is a “huge thing.”\\nThe true purpose of cryptocurrency, according to Dent, is to restructure the entire financial assets market, which is the largest financial number in the world. Global GDP is roughly $100 trillion Dent explained, while financial assets “is the largest multiplier,” around $600 trillion. “That’s why I’m bullish on bitcoin and crypto,” Dent said.\\nWhat do you think about Harry Dent’s predictions for the future of gold and bitcoin?

Kiyosaki tweeted Thursday that people who own gold, silver, and bitcoin will get richer when the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and Wall Street pivot and trillions of dollars are printed. “Fake money savers will be the biggest losers,” he stressed.  The famous author has warned on several occasions that the U.S. pension crisis is much worse than we thought. In 2020, he co-authored a book titled “Who Stole My Pension?” with Edward Siedle. In the book, the authors discussed “the greatest retirement crisis in the history of our nation and … the entire world.” When pension funds almost collapsed recently in England, Kiyosaki warned that a similar situation could happen in the U.S. Kiyosaki previously explained that “the U.S. dollar became fake money” when President Richard Nixon removed it from the gold standard in 1971. “This is because rather than being tied to real money,” such as gold, “it was tied to the ‘full faith and credit’ of the United States,” the Rich Dad Poor Dad author noted. In September, he said the end of fake money is here; he expects the U.S. dollar to crash by January. The renowned author has said repeatedly that he doesn’t trust the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, President Joe Biden, and Wall Street. In February, he warned that the Fed and the Treasury are destroying the U.S. dollar, advising people to buy bitcoin. He recently stressed that cryptocurrency cannot be blamed for the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, emphasizing that bitcoin is not the problem. He called former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried the Bernie Madoff of crypto.

The American central bank said on Wednesday that the hike aims to curb inflation and the Fed says “recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production.” While U.S. president Joe Biden hosted an event called the “Infrastructure Talent Pipeline Challenge,” the country’s central bank increased the FFR once again by 75bps on Wednesday. Markets had priced in and predicted the 75bps increase well before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) convened. Just before the rate hike, the White House reported that the Biden administration plans to allocate $13.5 billion to help low-income American households pay for heating this winter. This is due to the fact that red-hot inflation has contributed to U.S. consumers paying 28% more to heat their residences than they did last winter. “Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production,” the FOMC announcement said on Wednesday. “Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures,” the central bank added. The Fed’s FOMC statement continued: Russia’s war against Ukraine is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The war and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. The Fed’s rate hike follows the U.S. central bank’s key inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index report, showing an increase of 0.5% in September. Moreover, the most recent consumer price index (CPI) report, noted U.S. consumer prices jumped 8.2% in September. Stocks jumped ahead after the Fed announced the 75bps raise and bitcoin (BTC) also jumped 1% in the last hour following the announcement. The price of gold, per troy ounce, jumped 0.98% higher, while the price of one ounce of fine silver increased by 1.58% over the $20 per ounce region. Markets rebounded as the Fed’s announcement hinted at a possible pivot. “The committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments,” the U.S. central bank said. Freddie Mac reported last week that the average rate of a 30-year fixed mortgage jumped above 7%, after it was only 3.14% a year ago. The FFR increase will likely slowly trickle down to mortgage, credit, and lending rates affecting every American citizen looking to access these financial vehicles. During Jerome Powell’s follow-up speech, he still insisted that rate hikes and monetary tightening were and still are needed to address the country’s red-hot inflation. Powell remarked on multiple occasions that the 2% inflation rate is still a strong goal the Federal Reserve is aiming for at the moment. Although, he also said a slowdown in restrictive measures “is coming” and insisted it could very well happen “as soon as the next meeting or the one after that,” when reporters asked the central bank chief if the Fed would pivot by December. Following Powell’s news conference with reporters, stocks, precious metals, and bitcoin started to lose the gains they saw an hour after the FOMC statement was released. By 2:55 p.m. (ET), all four major stock indexes declined, gold was up by 0.13%, and BTC was up by 0.6% on Wednesday afternoon. What do you think about the Fed’s fourth consecutive 75bps rate hike?

He warned that rate hikes will kill the U.S. economy, cautioning that stock, bond, and real estate markets will crash. He stressed that the Fed will pivot, advising investors to buy gold, silver, and bitcoin before the Fed pivot occurs.  Many economists and strategists have predicted that the Fed will not pivot anytime soon. Strategists and fund managers told Reuters’ Global Market Forum Friday that a Fed pivot is not on the horizon even as over-tightening risks loom. They believe that there is a greater chance of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates too far and tipping the U.S. economy into a recession. Bank of America’s strategists, led by Michael Hartnett, wrote in a note Friday that it is too early for a Fed policy pivot “absent sudden collapse in inflation & payrolls.” JPMorgan strategist Julia Wang said Thursday that a Fed pivot is unlikely in the near future given persistent inflation. She told Bloomberg: “For us to get to a point where labor market conditions are more fundamentally consistent with the Fed’s inflation target, we think will probably take us to end of next year. So hence, that’s why we expect a pivot really only in Q4 2023.” This was not the first time that the renowned author said Fed rate hikes will destroy the U.S. economy. He gave a similar warning in September. Last week, Kiyosaki said the U.S. dollar is toast citing Saudi Arabia’s request to join the BRICS nations. Moreover, he predicted that the U.S. dollar will crash by January and warned about World War III. The Rich Dad Poor Dad author has been pushing bitcoin for quite some time. Earlier this month, he explained the reason he buys BTC. He has distinguished the largest crypto from fake money on several occasions, emphasizing that the end of fake money is here.

Citing inflation, he detailed that pension funds are investing in cryptocurrency, adding that they know “fake” money, stocks, and bonds “are toast.” The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, shared why he buys bitcoin in a couple of tweets Friday. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries. In one tweet, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author detailed that he buys bitcoin because pension funds are buying the cryptocurrency. He referenced an article published by Forbes, titled “Your State Pension Is Now Gambling On Cryptocurrency,” which features a survey showing that 94% of America’s state and local government pensions are investing in cryptocurrencies. Tweeting the article to his 1.2 million followers, Kiyosaki wrote: Why I buy bitcoin. Pension funds are biggest investment businesses in the world. The survey is part of the latest Investor Trust Study, published in April by the CFA Institute, the global association of investment professionals. The study showed that institutional investors have become bigger users of cryptocurrencies, with two-thirds saying they are currently invested in these products. In addition, government-sponsored pension plans are the most likely to be invested in crypto assets. In another tweet, Kiyosaki elaborated on why he has recommended buying gold, silver, and bitcoin. The famous author explained that when pensions nearly collapsed, it exposed central banks cannot fix inflation. He noted that pensions have always invested in gold and silver, and now they are investing in bitcoin.  Last week, the Bank of England told lawmakers that a number of pension funds were hours from collapse when it decided to intervene in the British bond market after a massive U.K. government bond sell-off. Kiyosaki also stated in his tweet that pension funds know that fake money, stocks, and bonds “are toast.” The famous author recently warned that the end of fake money is here, urging investors to invest in “real money,” naming gold, silver, and bitcoin. The renowned author has been recommending buying bitcoin alongside gold and silver for quite some time. Last month, he urged investors to get into crypto now, before the biggest crash in world history strikes. He noted in June that he is waiting for the price of bitcoin to test $1,100.

Savers will be biggest losers. Invest in REAL MONEY. Gold, silver & bitcoin. A number of economists, such as those at brokerage firm Nomura Securities, are predicting a 100 bps increase in the Fed’s benchmark short-term rate next week. Investment strategist Ed Yardeni told CNBC Friday that he believes the Fed is “going to come around and conclude that maybe just get it over with, maybe 100 basis points instead of 75 basis points. And then maybe one more hike after that.” Some people, such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood, have warned that a major Fed rate hike risks deflation in the U.S. economy.

The network’s block subsidy halving is expected to occur on or around April 20, 2024, as there are less than 91,000 bitcoins left to mine until that point. While Bitcoin’s inflation rate per annum is 1.73% today, after the halving in 2024, the crypto asset’s yearly inflation rate will be down to 1.1%. Time goes by fast and today, there’s less than two years left until the next Bitcoin reward halving takes place roughly 617 days from now. Bitcoin gives miners a reward every time a block is discovered by a miner dedicating hashrate to the network. At the time of writing, miners get 6.25 bitcoins per block and on or around April 20, 2024, the block reward will be cut in half to 3.125 bitcoins per block. At that time, it will be a lot more difficult to obtain bitcoins via the mining process and today, there are only 1.88 million bitcoins left to mine. Bitcoin is a very predictable monetary network that operates in an autonomous fashion. Unlike the unpredictable inflation rate in the U.S., people can safely predict Bitcoin’s inflation rate per annum. There’s no stimulus added to the equation and central bankers cannot change Bitcoin’s issuance rate per year on a whim as they often do when there’s an ‘emergency.’ When the next Bitcoin halving takes place, Bitcoin’s issuance rate per year will be 1.1%. With Bitcoin’s open network, the public knows this for a fact. The Federal Reserve, on the other hand, can cause busts and booms by increasing the monetary supply and hiking and lowering the benchmark federal funds rate. While the precious metal gold is considered scarce and people suspect the price of gold will rise during economic uncertainty, that’s not necessarily a fact. Research shows that gold has “an extremely low correlation to inflation.” While Bitcoin is a very predictable financial system, the crypto asset itself has a low correlation to inflation as well. As the consumer price index (CPI) in the U.S. and inflation rates across the world have risen, bitcoin (BTC) dropped in value while inflation printed higher peaks month after month. While BTC hasn’t seen much correlation with inflation — like gold and silver — it is still a more predictable asset class than precious metals. We have rough estimates on how much gold is mined annually, as statistics show that roughly 2,500 tons are mined out of the earth every year. But thanks to gold smuggling, that estimate is really just an educated guess. Surprise gold deposits also hurt gold’s alleged scarcity factor and it is well known that there are massive gold deposits under the ocean floor, and within asteroids in space as well. However, at present, humans cannot access the gold in space or under the depths of the ocean. Gold is still considered scarce despite these elements. A U.S. Geological Survey estimate says there’s roughly 50,000 tons of gold under the earth’s surface, but the estimate is assessed as “a moving number.” As far as Bitcoin’s monetary supply is concerned, the public knows for a fact that there will only be 21 million bitcoin. With gold we know there’s roughly 20% of the earth’s gold remaining, but because some methods of mining are uneconomical right now, there’s a chance they could become profitable in the future. Meaning, there’s a chance that technology advances enough to where gold miners can access the precious metals buried under the ocean floor or in asteroids out in space. If this happened, gold and other precious metals could become a lot less scarce just like the fiat money central bankers print on a whim. With Bitcoin, we know that’s not the case, and won’t be, as the network’s inflation rate per annum will continue to decline. At the time of writing, we know the Bitcoin inflation rate is around 1.73% and as mentioned above, by the next halving it will shrink to 1.1% in 2024. By the next year in 2025, Bitcoin’s inflation rate per annum will drop below 1% and by the 2028 halving, the issuance rate will be around 0.5% per annum. We also know that the last bitcoins will be mined in the year 2140, but we are not certain about the finality of gold mining. Moreover, after the central bank’s monetary expansion over the last two years, estimating the inflation rate bankers set is like trying to read tea leaves. While bitcoin may not be the best hedge against inflation, at least for right now, we can guarantee that the asset is scarce and far more predictable than any popular monetary asset issued or mined today.

A top official emphasized the department means that cryptocurrencies may be used in barter deals, but not as legal tender. Cryptocurrency payments, in terms of international transactions, are seen by the authorities in Moscow as an alternative option for small private business contracts, but this will not affect Russian oil deliveries. The clarification was made by the head of the finance ministry’s Financial Policy Department, Ivan Chebeskov, who recently spoke with reporters on the matter. The ministry proposes to employ cryptocurrency as an asset, not as a means of payment, the high-ranking official remarked. That means digital currencies can be used in barter transactions — when a buyer formally exchanges bitcoins, or other cryptocurrencies, for a product or service, he explained. Quoted by RTVI, Chebeskov elaborated: The task is to provide an alternative, and not to say that Russia is now paying for everything with crypto. This is not about state settlements but private business only. The Minfin representative pointed out that oil would hardly be sold for bitcoins due to large volumes of these exports. And while not all of Russia’s partners would be able to transition to national currencies despite the increasing difficulties with U.S. dollar and euro payments, he believes crypto settlements are only possible under relatively small contracts and with friendly countries open to accepting coins. Chebeskov’s comments come after an earlier statement by the head of the parliamentary Energy Committee, Pavel Zavalny, who mentioned bitcoin as a possible substitute for western currencies in Russian energy exports, those of natural gas in particular. Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Russia has softened its stance on crypto payments within the context of foreign trade relations. In May, a provision allowing Russian companies to make such transactions for import and export purposes was added to the new bill “On Digital Currency” drafted by the Ministry of Finance. Recognizing cryptocurrency as property in Russia’s Civil Code and amending an article on barter exchanges in the legislation governing foreign economic activities of Russian entities are also necessary to fully open the door for this type of deal, the report details. The United States and its allies have been trying to prevent the Russian Federation from utilizing cryptocurrencies to circumvent sanctions imposed over its ongoing military invasion of neighboring Ukraine. Some global crypto platforms have already blocked Russian accounts, RTVI notes. Do you think Russia may change its mind about crypto payments in oil trade?

Schiff further explained in several tweets Sunday: “With food and energy prices soaring, many bitcoin Hodlers will be forced to sell to cover the cost. Grocery stores and gas stations don’t accept bitcoin.” The economist noted: “When Bitcoin crashed during Covid no one needed to sell. Consumer prices were much lower and Hodlers got stimulus checks.” Schiff stressed: The need to sell bitcoin to pay the bills will only get worse as the recession deepens and many Hodlers lose their jobs, especially those working for soon to be bankrupt blockchain companies. “If circumstances change, long-term buyers without paychecks will be forced to sell,” he added. Most bitcoin proponents continue to ignore all bitcoin and crypto predictions made by Schiff, with many seeing his gloomy expectations as a buy signal for BTC. “Possibly the most consistently bad investment advice on public record,” one Twitter user wrote. Another asked Schiff: “Check bitcoin or Ethereum 5-year charts, then check gold’s. Which would you rather have held? Which would you rather hold for another 5 years?” At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $26,212.07 whereas ether is at $1,373.77. Furthermore, a growing number of grocery stores and gas stations have started accepting bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrencies. Sheetz, a major Mid-Atlantic restaurant and convenience chain, announced in May last year that it had become the “first convenience store chain to accept bitcoin.” Several convenience stores and gas stations have also installed two-way bitcoin ATMs, including a leading convenience and fuel retailer, Circle K. While Schiff is bearish about bitcoin, ether, and the crypto market in general, many people are very bullish about BTC. Venture capitalist Tim Draper recently doubled down on his $250K bitcoin prediction. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz said he is “incredibly bullish” on bitcoin and has a weekly BTC buy. Devere Group CEO Nigel Green said last week that he expects a bull run and a “significant bounce” in the price of bitcoin in the fourth quarter of this year. JPMorgan said last month that the firm sees a “significant upside” to bitcoin. The global investment bank has replaced real estate with crypto as its “preferred alternative asset.” Moreover, a recent Deloitte survey found that 85% of U.S. merchants say enabling crypto payments is a high priority for them.

Vaneck’s report explained that the investment team “attempted to quantify the emergence of new gold or bitcoin-backed currency regimes.” The study’s calculations estimate that gold could reach $31,000 per ounce and bitcoin could potentially hit $1.3 million per coin. If the assets became M2 monetary supplies, then the values of bitcoin and gold could be much higher.  Executives from Vaneck’s emerging markets (EM) bond investment team, Eric Fine and Natalia Gurushina, published a report on March 30, 2022, that touches on “extreme scenarios” where gold or bitcoin theoretically become M0 or M2 money supplies. While a monetary base (M0 or narrow money) equates to all the physical currency and coins, M2 measures both cash and checking deposits and broad money as well. Vaneck’s Insights blog post says “money has changed,” and highlights the recent sanctions against Russia which froze the country’s USD, EUR, and JPY fiat reserves. Fine and Gurushina write that Vaneck’s EM bond investment team thinks the world’s central banks “will act, as will private individual actors.” The team attempts to quantify the emergence of gold and bitcoin-backed regimes and after the calculations, both estimates are quite substantial in terms of price value. “We built a simple framework to value gold and bitcoin. For gold, we divide global money supply (M0 and M2) by global gold reserves,” the Vaneck EM bond investment team blog post explains. “The money liability is divided by the reserve asset. We used current reserve holdings in troy ounces for gold, and we used the current exchange rate to convert the monetary base liability into U.S. dollars.” The EM bond investment team explains that the implied global price for gold using M0 “divided by global gold reserves, for countries with the largest gold holdings is $31,000 per ounce (average) and $21,000 per ounce (median).” Additionally, the implied global price for gold using M2 data divided by global gold reserves is “around $105,000 per ounce,” Vaneck’s report notes. Vaneck’s team did the same calculations for bitcoin (BTC), in contrast to cryptocurrencies, because the potential supply of crypto is infinite while BTC has a 21 million coin supply cap. The report notes that the upside would be higher with bitcoin (33x) than gold (16x). “The implied price of bitcoin using the same aggregate M0 that we used for gold is around $1,300,000 per coin,” the authors noted in the report. Vaneck’s “extreme” scenario calculations further estimate: The implied price of bitcoin using global M2 is $4,800,000 per coin. The report’s authors stress that the circumstances required for this to happen would be an unusual event and “assumptions [are based] on the probability of that ‘extreme’ scenario occurring, or on the portion bitcoin will be fulfilling in any new reserve status,” Vaneck’s report states. At the end of Vaneck’s Insights blog post, the authors say that something big has happened, and they are attempting to quantify the impact. “‘Stories’ about the future of money are interesting, but if one agrees that this is a potentially new paradigm, an attempt at quantification is needed,” Vaneck’s report concludes. “That was our intent with this exercise – to be as specific as possible about a nebulous and complicated issue. The key asset-price implication of the big change is significant upside in gold and bitcoin.” What do you think about Vaneck’s report that attempts to quantify the future value of gold and bitcoin if they became global reserves?

Commenting on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicating last week that the first rate hike will be in March and will likely be 25 basis points, Siegel criticized that the Fed is already behind and should be making a more aggressive move. “They’re going to have to do much more than that … I’m actually disappointed that Chairman Powell did not look at the history that this is not a time for us to slow down,” the Wharton finance professor stressed, elaborating: The Fed has been terribly wrong over the last year. I mean, all this temporary inflation. Look at the protection they did for inflation last year — so way below what actually happened all the way to December. He said last week that it would be a “big policy mistake” for the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes because of the situation in Ukraine. While stating that “Jay Powell is a very good man” and “a good communicator,” Professor Siegel stressed: “The Fed has been very wrong and they are going to have to catch up and they really have to admit they’ve got to bite the bullet here.” Regarding bitcoin, he urged the Federal Reserve to take action to defend the U.S. dollar, emphasizing: We talk about bitcoin taking over. We’ve got to defend the dollar. The professor has been noting the rise in popularity of bitcoin for quite some time. In January, he said that BTC has replaced gold as an inflation hedge for millennials.

While the leading crypto asset bitcoin shed close to 10%, a myriad of alternative digital assets lost close to 20% in value. The crypto market downturn is being blamed on Russia invading Ukraine’s borders as Russian president Vladimir Putin’s troops entered the country before dawn on February 24. The digital currency community has been discussing the situation and many crypto advocates have different opinions about the current geopolitical risk and its future effects on the crypto economy. Following the report Bitcoin.com News published on Wednesday evening (EST), media reports disclosed that Russian troops have invaded Ukraine and acts of war have been committed. While the scope of the attack is uncertain, reports indicate that cruise missiles have been fired and there have been a few explosions adjacent to Kyiv’s international airport. As our newsdesk’s report noted yesterday, the geopolitical tension has caused stock markets and cryptocurrencies to fall significantly in value. At the time of writing, the entire crypto-economy has lost 11.1%, and just before Thursday’s opening bell, futures indicate that Wall Street stocks are in for a volatile day of trading. What happens with bitcoin and crypto during war. Guess we will find out. Yay history. — DaBean (@HoneyBadger10) February 24, 2022  Meanwhile, cryptocurrency advocates are talking about the Russia and Ukraine situation in great detail and discussing theories about the future of crypto markets amid the escalated conflict. For instance, the “reformed hedge-fund manager” and bitcoin proponent James Lavish told his 18,000 Twitter followers: “If you’re selling bitcoin here because of fears of war and civil unrest, you have absolutely no idea what you own and why it is so vitally important for the world at this very moment.” FTX CEO Samuel Bankman-Fried also discussed the situation in Ukraine and he stressed that war is “really bad for the world.” Bankman-Fried further noted that Eastern European financial systems and currencies were feeling the wrath of the storm. “It makes sense that stocks are down,” the FTX CEO said. “War is, generally, bad. What should BTC be doing here? — If the world gets sh***ier, people have less free cash. Basically, selling BTC — along with stocks, etc. — to pay for war.” The FTX executive added: On the other hand, this is likely destabilizing for Eastern European currencies. And, more generally, for Eastern European financial systems. Which means they might be looking to alternatives. If you were in Ukraine right now, where would you trust your money? Many crypto supporters continued to highlight that despite the market carnage, censorship-resistant cryptocurrencies are very important during times like these. “There’s a war going on outside,” an individual wrote on Twitter. “Tempted to say ‘crypto doesn’t matter today.’ But that’s BS. As long as the world is fueled by the traditional money printing machine the forever wars continue. Bitcoin adoption [and] blockchain tech will separate the nation-states from banks.” 💥BREAKING: USA to limit Russian trade and business in USD 🤔 — Bitcoin Archive 🗄🚀🌔 (@BTC_Archive) February 24, 2022  “It’s not World War III, it’s the best time to jump into bitcoin,” another individual tweeted. Microstrategy’s CEO Michael Saylor replaced the old “give peace a chance” adage with the word bitcoin and said: “Give bitcoin a chance.” Of course, the gold bug and economist Peter Schiff threw in his two cents about the Russian invasion, the Fed, gold, and bitcoin. “Perhaps, the Fed is relieved that Russia invaded Ukraine as now it has an excuse not to raise interest rates in March,” Schiff tweeted. “If it wasn’t this it would’ve been something else, but as far as excuses go this one’s hard to top. Gold spiked 1.5% and bitcoin dumped 5.5% on the news.” Schiff wholeheartedly believes that sanctions on Russia could end up making inflation jump even higher for Americans. Other observers agree with Schiff and think that the Fed will not accept fiscal responsibility after the Russian invasion. One crypto advocate on social media insisted: Inflation gets worse during war, not better. My prediction is that any attempts at fiscal responsibility by the Fed will go out the window. #Bitcoin. The conversation concerning the Federal Reserve is tied to the predicted rate hike slated for March. While the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) told the press it would raise the benchmark interest rate “soon,” Fed chair Jerome Powell remarked to the press that it would likely happen during the March FOMC meeting.

Speaking on the Orrin G. Hatch Foundation’s crypto webinar panel, Lummis said that once a regulatory policy is in place it “will make a lot of sense.” This week the Orrin G. Hatch Foundation published a webinar video featuring Bitstamp CEO Bobby Zagotta, former Federal Reserve vice chairman Randal Quarles, and the Republican senator from Wyoming, Cynthia Lummis. The host of the webinar Matt Sandgren mentioned to Quarles that in the early days, bitcoin was met with skepticism from Washington and Wall Street. Sandgren continued by adding that now things seem to be changing and he asked the former Federal Reserve vice chairman if he agreed perspectives have changed.  “I think in the early years it wasn’t really clear what the widespread use case would be for bitcoin or similar crypto assets,” Quarles replied. “They solved some technical issues in the payment system but the price volatility made them ill-suited to be an actual payments mechanism. So the principal attractions seem to be independence from the regulated monetary system and anonymity. Neither of those are going to be terribly attractive to Washington.” Quarles continued: For Wall Street, if you are an investor considering a novel technology with an unclear use case that’s likely to attract unwelcome attention from regulators and law enforcement you’re going to move slowly. Quarles then said that things are changing now for a few reasons and one of them includes stablecoins. He thinks because stablecoins “tame the volatility” they are more useful. Following Quarles’ statements and a description of what cryptocurrency is from Bitstamp’s Zagotta, Lummis told Sandgren that she thought it was a “great idea” for the Federal Reserve to purchase bitcoin and hold it on its balance sheet. “Once there is a statutory and regulatory framework, that will make a lot of sense — The fact that bitcoin is completely decentralized, it’s going to make it over time more ubiquitous,” Lummis remarked. The senator from Wyoming added: I think [bitcoin] is going to be something that the Fed should hold on its balance sheet. Senator Cynthia Lummis has been a fan of bitcoin and digital currencies for quite some time and she recently thanked God for bitcoin when the U.S. Congress discussed raising the debt ceiling. During the first week of October, Lummis disclosed that she purchased more bitcoin and said she sees BTC as an “excellent store of value.” However, panel speaker Quarles did not agree with Lummis’ opinion, and he stressed it is unlikely that the U.S. central bank will add BTC to its balance sheet. “For a lot of political, economic reasons,” Quarles said. “I think that it’s best to keep the Fed’s balance sheet.” During her panel statements, Lummis reiterated that she believes bitcoin is a store of value, scarce, and predictable. “Bitcoin is digital gold — it’s hard money — There will only be 21 million ever produced,” Lummis insisted during the panel webinar.

Zach Pandl, bank’s co-head of foreign exchange strategy, and FX analyst Isabella Rosenberg explained that as mainstream adoption of bitcoin increases, so does the cryptocurrency’s vulnerability to Fed policy. They described: Over the last two years, as bitcoin has seen wider mainstream adoption, its correlation with macro assets has picked up. Noting that higher bond yields have affected technology stocks in recent weeks, with the Nasdaq 100 index falling more than 13% for the year, the analysts noted: “Bitcoin and other digital assets have likely suffered from the same forces … These assets will not be immune to macroeconomic forces, including central bank monetary tightening.” The markets now expect the Fed to hike interest rates five times this year. Goldman Sachs believes that the Fed could raise interest rates at every meeting this year. The post-meeting statement from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last week did not provide a specific time for when the increase will come, though indications are that it could happen as soon as the March meeting. Goldman’s analysts further commented: Over time, further development of blockchain technology, including applications in the metaverse, may provide a secular tailwind to valuations for certain digital assets. Recently, Goldman Sachs said that the metaverse could be an $8 trillion opportunity. Rival investment bank Morgan Stanley similarly estimated a comparable size for the metaverse. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs predicted that bitcoin could reach $100,000 as the cryptocurrency continues to take gold’s market share. Meanwhile, Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS, has warned of a crypto winter amid expectations of Fed rate hikes and regulation. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $37,502 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets. The crypto is up 6.6% in the last seven days but down 20.5% in the past 30 days.

On Wednesday, the U.S. central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said it plans to taper quantitative easing (large monthly asset purchases) and end the program by March 2022. Moreover, the FOMC members decided to keep interest rates at zero but expect at least three rate hikes next year. Since the onset of Covid-19 in the United States, the U.S. Federal Reserve initiated a monetary easing policy like no other in history. The move has led to a surge in inflation and analysts and economists worldwide have criticized the Fed’s decisions in recent times. The FOMC concluded a two-day meeting on Wednesday and the central bank explained that it plans to shrink its bond purchase program to $30 billion per month by January. This month the Fed will leverage $90 billion in quantitative easing (QE) purchases as opposed to last month’s $120 billion. In addition to the tapering of QE, the FOMC members also detailed that the central bank has plans for three rate hikes next year. It expects three in 2022, two more rate hikes in 2023, and another two interest rate increases in 2024. The Fed did not, however, blame the rising inflation in the U.S. on its QE but instead noted that the inflation was caused by issues with supply and demand. “Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation,” the FOMC said on Wednesday. Furthermore, the FOMC statements said Covid-19, and new coronavirus variants, have affected the U.S. economy a great deal. Despite the taper statements and disclosing that there will likely be three rate hikes next year, the Fed’s comments saw a market reaction opposite to what was predicted before the taper announcement. Nasdaq, NYSE, and the Dow Jones all saw gains after the FOMC meeting concluded. Speaking with Bitcoin.com News, Alex Kuptsikevich, the Fxpro senior market analyst, said the Fed “held the most hawkish edge of market expectations” on Wednesday. “The FOMC announced that it would double the pace of tapering,” Kuptsikevich said. “The committee’s updated forecasts suggest three key rate hikes in 2022, although only six months ago, it expected none. We also heard that the balance of the Fed’s targets allows a rate hike to begin before achieving full employment due to higher inflation.” “The Fed chairman also called financial asset valuations ‘elevated,’” the market analyst continued. “This is a clear signal of a willingness to hurt the markets, as he did in 2018. During the press conference, Powell noted that FOMC did not yet have a consensus on the timing of the Fed’s balance sheet cut. In the previous stimulus wind-down cycle, this was not an actual issue long after the start of the rate hike — The dollar index rallied within the first minutes after the FOMC, touching the highs from July 2020, but then it turned back down, losing 0.8% from the peak at the time of writing.” Kuptsikevich added: The feeling is that the markets have prepared for a risk-on, expecting softness from the Fed, and have not backed down despite the Fed’s rhetoric. Some commentators believe we saw a classical ‘buy rumours, sell facts’ reaction. However, the rise in ‘growth’ stocks speaks more about the market mood to end a strong year on a cheerful note. At the same time on the dollar, a wave of profit-taking growth in the last six months seems to have started, although the Fed’s stance is much more hawkish compared to other central banks from the DXY basket. Even bitcoin (BTC) defied expectations on Wednesday, as the price kicked up a notch after the FOMC’s hawkish plans were announced. Just before the meeting ended, BTC was exchanging hands for $46,590 per unit and after the FOMC meeting came to a conclusion, BTC prices jumped to a $49,420 high on Wednesday afternoon (EST). In addition to the FOMC meeting, the Bank of England (BoE) kicked up its benchmark rate to 0.25% from 0.1%. No other central banks have done this yet and the European Central Bank, like the Federal Reserve, kept its benchmark interest rate suppressed for now. The European Central Bank explained that it will not raise borrowing rates until inflation settles. In addition, the U.S. weekly jobless claims published by the Labor Department indicate a rise last week. The Labor Department’s report shows jobless claims are still well above pre-pandemic levels.

During his company’s Q3 earnings call last week, Galaxy Digital Holdings CEO Mike Novogratz talked about bitcoin being a better store of value than gold. While stating, “I still think gold was probably an okay asset to own in this environment,” he emphasized that “It’s just gotten crushed by bitcoin.” Novogratz added: Bitcoin is just a better version of a store value and it’s being accepted at an accelerating pace … There are now over two hundred million people around the world that participate in the bitcoin ecosystem, and it continues to grow. Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci also expects bitcoin to outperform gold. He said last week that bitcoin “will eventually eclipse gold.” He has been saying that it is still very, very early for bitcoin, predicting that the price of the cryptocurrency will easily reach $500K. He urges investors to own some BTC now. In a discussion about market capitalization, Scaramucci opined: I think it’s probably going to be ten times better than gold over a long period of time … I’m not going to be surprised if bitcoin goes up at an exponential rate and gold goes up at a linear one. Another famed fund manager who recently admitted that he prefers bitcoin over gold is Paul Tudor Jones. He said last month that he prefers bitcoin as a hedge against inflation in the current economic environment, stating: Clearly, there’s a place for crypto. Clearly, it’s winning the race against gold at the moment … It would be my preferred one over gold at the moment. Global investment bank JPMorgan said in October that institutional investors have been dumping gold for bitcoin. “Institutional investors appear to be returning to bitcoin perhaps seeing it as a better inflation hedge than gold,” the firm’s analysts described. In September, the pro-bitcoin Nasdaq-listed company Microstrategy said it avoided “a multi-billion dollar mistake” by choosing bitcoin over gold last year. The company now hodls about 114,042 BTC. CEO Michael Saylor said last week that he expects bitcoin to become a $100 trillion asset class. “It’s pretty clear that bitcoin is winning, gold is losing … and it’s going to continue … It’s pretty clear digital gold is going to replace gold this decade,” Saylor opined. Goldman Sachs’ head of energy research said recently that he has seen funds moving out of gold into bitcoin. “Just like we argue that silver is the poor man’s gold, gold is maybe becoming the poor man’s crypto,” the executive noted.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk made several tweets about the U.S. national debt and government spending last week. He also warned against the proposal to tax unrealized capital gains, aimed at billionaires, which was scuttled Friday amid questions about whether it would even be constitutional. Musk believes that if the proposal were to go ahead, the government would not stop at billionaires. “Eventually, they run out of other people’s money and then they come for you,” he tweeted early last week. Commenting on a Washington Post article stating that he would “pay as much as $50 billion under the tax over its first five years, while Bezos could pay as much as $44 billion,” the Tesla CEO tweeted to his 61.7 million followers: “According to their own estimates, this tax only covers ~10% of the $3.5 trillion spending bill. Where will the other 90% come from? The answer is you.” The Tesla boss proceeded to explain that the U.S. national debt is currently about $28.9 trillion or $229K per taxpayer, asserting that even if all billionaires are taxed at 100%, it would only make a small dent in the debt number. “The rest must come from the general public,” he stressed. “This is basic math.” Musk elaborated: Spending is the real problem … U.S. federal debt/GDP was 56% in 2000, now it is 126% & climbing fast.  Musk’s comments have drawn much attention. At the time of writing, his tweet has been liked 34K times and retweeted 7,123 times. Some people strongly disagree with Musk, accusing the Tesla billionaire of not understanding economics and avoiding paying taxes. “Has anyone explained money creation to Elon?” one person tweeted. Several pointed out that his companies are heavily subsidized by the government. One person wrote: “How do you think you became the richest man in the world? Could’ve been the $5 billion the US government gave you to start your companies?” Another said, “Spacex and Tesla only exist because of government spending.” A third person acknowledged that “Taxation is theft,” but told Musk: “You’re a hypocrite … Pay back the billions in government subsidies you received first and then you will be able to argue against taxation.” Meanwhile, many people agreed with Musk on the government spending problem and mounting national debt, stating that this is why they put their money in crypto. Marcelo Claure, CEO of Softbank Group International, simply replied, “Totally agree.” Lawyer John Deaton described: “The politicians’ intent is so transparent. Classic divide & conquer strategy by employing class warfare. It’s only against the billionaires – Until it isn’t. Do the math.” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong agreed with Musk, stating: “Exactly — it’s gotten completely out of hand. If they are going to keep printing to service the debt and cover the deficit, then this will accelerate the move into crypto.” The mayor of the city of Miami, Francis Suarez, who has been trying to build his city into a bitcoin hub, chimed in: It’s why bitcoin has become so valuable. An unmanipulatable currency/store of value. On Sunday, Musk said that he would sell his Tesla shares if it would solve the world hunger problem. Responding to a comment by the director of the United Nations’ World Food Program (WFP) that 2% of his wealth could solve world hunger, Musk wrote: “If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it.” However, he emphasized: “But it must be open source accounting, so the public sees precisely how the money is spent.” What do you think about Elon Musk’s comments?

Bitcoin is among his recommendations for smart investing. Famous author and investor Robert Kiyosaki has warned of a new depression in the U.S. following a “giant crash.” Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries. The famous author tweeted Friday that the U.S. is “sliding into depression.” He said President Joe Biden and the Fed are “ripping off people,” noting that they “need inflation to prevent new depression.” Kiyosaki stressed: “Inflation rips off the poor. Inflation makes [the] rich richer. Biden and Fed corrupt.” He continued: Prepare: Giant crash then new depression. Be smart: Buy, gold, silver, bitcoin. A number of people have voiced similar concerns about inflation. Senator Rick Scott (R-Fla) said on Fox News Sunday that Americans should be furious with the way Democrats are handling their money, adding that President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better agenda will only worsen the country’s “ridiculous” inflation. “If you look at what they’re talking about with this — name whatever the bill is — all it’s going to do is cause more inflation … Look at what it’s doing to poor families in this country, with gas prices up 55%. Go to the grocery store, food prices are up. It’s all caused by government spending,” he opined. This is not the first time Kiyosaki has warned that a major crash is coming. In September, he said: “Giant stock market crash coming October. Why? Treasury and Fed short of T-bills.” He noted at the time that “Gold, silver, bitcoin may crash too,” adding that cash is “best for picking up bargains after [the] crash.” The famous author emphasized that he is not selling gold, silver or bitcoin. Kiyosaki has been recommending BTC to investors for quite some time. Earlier this month, he said: “I love bitcoin because I do not trust Fed, Treasury, or Wall Street.” When the price of BTC rose above $60K, Kiyosaki tweeted: “Future very bright. Celebrate yet be cautious. I am waiting for a pullback before investing more.” In August, he said bitcoin was the investment with “the greatest upside.” What do you think about Robert Kiyosaki’s warning?

Noting that investors are pulling out of gold ETFs into bitcoin funds, the firm noted, “The flow shift remains intact supporting a bullish outlook for bitcoin into year-end.” JPMorgan Chase’s analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, published a research note last week explaining that inflation has been driving up the price of bitcoin to all-time highs rather than the hype around the first U.S. bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF). Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, ticker BITO, began trading Tuesday and rapidly amassed $1 billion in investments. The second bitcoin futures ETF in the U.S. launched Friday. The JPMorgan analysts believe that “By itself, the launch of BITO is unlikely to trigger a new phase of significantly more fresh capital entering bitcoin,” elaborating: Instead, we believe the perception of bitcoin as a better inflation hedge than gold is the main reason for the current upswing, triggering a shift away from gold ETFs into bitcoin funds since September. The analysts added that “The initial hype with BITO could fade after a week.” The price of bitcoin soared to an all-time high of $66,899 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets on Tuesday. At the time of writing, BTC’s price is around $61,249. It has risen approximately 40% since the beginning of the month and more than 90% since the beginning of the year. The price of BTC rose significantly when the market anticipated the approval of a bitcoin futures ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Not only have the JPMorgan analysts explained that the real driver behind the price increase of bitcoin was growing concerns over inflation, but they have also noted that it has pushed investors to seek investments that can act as a hedge against this risk, such as gold and bitcoin. Gold used to be an effective tool to hedge against inflation. However, it has failed in recent weeks to respond to heightened concerns over rising cost pressures. This had driven investors to explore alternative investments, and many have shifted away from gold ETFs into bitcoin funds, the analysts noted, adding: This flow shift remains intact supporting a bullish outlook for bitcoin into year-end. JPMorgan’s analysts are not the only ones viewing bitcoin as a better hedge against inflation than gold.

Senator Cynthia Lummis praised bitcoin during her speech on the Senate floor last week about raising the U.S. debt limit. The senator has been a bitcoin hodler since 2013 and has repeatedly stated that bitcoin is a great store of value. Lummis pointed out that while lawmakers were intensely discussing raising the debt limit, “almost no one is talking about the debt” itself. “We are getting closer to $30 trillion. Certainly, if the spending that is being entertained by the majority party and the Biden administration passes, it will be over $30 trillion,” she warned. The senator from Wyoming explained: Countries have historically tended to decline once the debt surpassed their gross domestic product. Citing the Congressional budget office stating in February that the national debt would surpass the country’s GDP this year, the senator exclaimed: “The debt ceiling increase that is being discussed here is so more spending can occur without addressing our debt-to-GDP ratio. We cannot go on like this. It is irresponsible at the deepest levels.” The senator warned, “we are swiftly approaching a time when we will be unable to” pay our debt holders. She proceeded to share: One of the reasons that I became so interested in digital currencies, in non-fiat currencies, is because they are not issued by a government. Bitcoin is not issued by a government so it’s not beholding to the debts that are run up by governments. Lummis asserted, “If we are going to let the dollar decline, having the lessons of history in front of us, and failing to act, we are truly irresponsible.” She elaborated: “In the event that that contingency occurs, I want to make sure that non-fiat currencies — currencies not issued by governments, currencies not beholden to political elections — can grow, can allow people to save, can be there in the event that we fail at what we know we have to do.” Noting that “There’s no proof yet in the 21st century that we are going to make this right. Time and again, in the U.S. House and the Senate, time and again, presidents of both parties have run up the debt irresponsibly, with no plan to address it,” the senator described, adding: So, thank God for bitcoin, and other non-fiat currencies, that transcends the irresponsibility of governments, including our own.

A recent report details that remittance providers like Moneygram and Western Union could lose up to $400 million annually if the Chivo wallet is used more. Furthermore, the creator of the world wide web, Tim Berners-Lee has written an opinion piece about why Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele announced the bitcoin tender law at the Miami bitcoin conference. Ever since El Salvador adopted bitcoin (BTC) as legal currency on September 7, 2021, the country has continued to be a topic of discussion. Bitcoin.com News has reported on the many developments in El Salvador from ‘Bitcoin Beach’ to the ‘30for30’ trend that took place this week. Moreover, the country started buying mass quantities of bitcoin (BTC) before the legalization was implemented. The very next day, during the bitcoin (BTC) market rout, Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele said El Salvador “bought the dip.” Additionally, Bitcoin.com News reported on the government bitcoin wallet called Chivo and how the wallet had a number of launch issues during the launch day. However, the following day the ability to download the Chivo wallet was easier and Bukele said the wallet’s maintenance was completed. A recent report published by CNBC explains that if the Chivo wallet happens to gather mass adoption and removes remittance customers from financial institutions they could lose millions. CNBC’s MacKenzie Sigalos reports that “should the population adopt bitcoin at scale,” there’s a chance that “Western Union and MoneyGram will lose $400 million a year in commissions for remittances.” In El Salvador, remittances make up 50% of a citizen’s total income and they make up close to a quarter of the country’s GDP. Sigalos highlights that roughly 70% of the population in El Salvador receives remittances. Sigalos reached out to Western Union and asked the company if it was worried about this possible transition. The reporter wrote: Western Union did not reply to a CNBC request for comment about whether the company was worried about how this might affect business and if there was any plan to alter the fee structure to adjust for increased competition. In addition to the reports of remittance firms being hurt by the Chivo wallet, numerous individuals have given their two cents on the El Salvador bitcoin adoption subject. On Wednesday, Bitcoin.com News covered the sentiment stemming from the famous whistleblower Edward Snowden as he said competing nations are now under pressure to acquire BTC as El Salvador did. Furthermore, the creator of the world wide web, Tim Berners-Lee has written about El Salvador adopting bitcoin as well. Berners-Lee is well known for being one of the earliest reporters to cover the subject of bitcoin (BTC) when he wrote articles for Ars Technica. In his latest article published on fullstackeconomics.com discusses why he thinks president Bukele announced the new law at the Miami bitcoin conference. Berners-Lee explains critically and says: “It’s not clear if forcing merchants to adopt bitcoin will actually help people who lack banking services. Bitcoin requires Internet access, which is spotty in many parts of El Salvador. And bitcoin may prove too complex and cumbersome for everyday use,” the inventor of the world wide web stressed. Berners-Lee articulated how the CEO of Strike, Jack Mallers, revealed the news at the conference during an “emotional and profanity-laden address.” Berners-Lee remarked that the announcement was made at an “unorthodox venue” and he highlighted that “Bukele’s own speech was rather vague about how bitcoin would help El Salvador.” The world wide web creator said it was “telling” how Bukele chose to make his announcement. Berners-Lee said: It’s telling that Bukele chose to announce the initiative in English, at a Bitcoin conference in the United States, rather than addressing a domestic audience. One of his goals seems to be to get Bitcoiners around the world—some of whom are quite wealthy—to visit El Salvador and start businesses there. Berners-Lee further said that there’s a chance that by becoming the “world’s most bitcoin-friendly jurisdiction” it just might lead to “a savvy tourism and business development strategy.” But the English computer scientist continued to criticize the concept and noted that Bukele’s experiment could hurt Salvadorans. “At the same time,” Berners-Lee wrote. “You can see why this might rub some Salvadorans the wrong way. Bukele’s experiment will impose real costs on small shopkeepers who may not be in the tourism business and may never see significant bitcoin business.” What do you think about the possibility of the Salvadoran government’s Chivo wallet hurting big remittance providers like Moneygram and Western Union?

The recent PCE spike is the highest year-over-year basis change since 1992 and the statistic is fueling inflation concerns. After more than a year of lockdowns and business shutdowns alongside the massive monetary expansion introduced by the Federal Reserve, economists are worried about rising inflation. Last week the Fed revealed its possible future interest-rate decisions and global markets shuddered for a couple of days and then recovered. Northmantrader.com founder, technical analyst, and macroeconomic commentator, Sven Henrich, jokingly wrote about the manipulated markets in a blog post called “The Never Ending Rally.” Henrich remarked on how the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Neel Kashkari made markets feel better on Friday. “Last week’s trial balloon by the Fed, if that was the intent, made it clear again that this market runs not only on easy money, but also on the continued expectation of easy money,” Henrich wrote. “So the Fed followed its long adopted approach to monetary policy: Go in big, go in fast, and go out excruciatingly slow for fear of the consequences of upsetting markets.” While Wall Street is getting the benefits from the Fed, Americans returning back to work are facing an assault on their purchasing power. Even retirees are getting hammered with inflation woes as Barron’s award-winning financial columnist Gail MarksJarvis explained on Saturday. “As the pandemic fades and the country reopens,” MarksJarvis said, “retirees are emerging to the unsettling whiff of inflation. Gas prices are up more than 50% year over year. Grocery prices have climbed 2.2% overall. Airfares are up nearly 25%.”  Amid the never-ending market rally for a small privileged few, core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index data was published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on Friday. The data was concerning because the PCE rose 3.4% higher than the number for May 2020, which is the largest year-over-year increase in close to three decades. The BEA is a U.S. government agency that provides economic and market statistics. Every month, the BEA releases data on the total value of American consumption expenditures. The PCE price index found in the BEA’s Personal Income and Outlays report, and shows the changes in inflation tied to everyday goods and services purchased by U.S. consumers. All kinds of commodities and for-profit solutions are mixed into the PCE equation like services, nondurable goods, and durable goods. Despite the dreary PCE data, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note spiked by almost four basis points, and gold markets jumped higher as well. Similar to Henrich, economist and gold bug Peter Schiff has also been commenting on the Fed’s monetary theatrics and even published a radio broadcast called “Everything Is Awesome Because the Fed Says so.” “High inflation keeps pushing the price of oil higher,” Schiff tweeted on Friday. “So far today it’s already hit $73.40, the highest price since Oct. of 2018. Yet investors aren’t buying gold because instead of looking at what’s actually happening to oil, they believe the Fed that it’s only transitory.” Schiff added: New definition of transitory: An adverse permanent change in conditions that if fully appreciated by the public or investors would accelerate both the impact on an economy or financial markets, and the damage done to the reputations of incumbent administrations or central banks. As concerns about rate hikes and the recent PCE data rattled markets, Coinshares’ James Butterfill published a report on how data suggests that bitcoin is beginning to fulfill the role of an inflation hedge. “Observing bitcoin’s price changes relative to changes in inflation shows that this relationship is becoming statistically significant,” Butterfill’s research highlights.  The researcher’s report details that it’s difficult to know if inflation is headed our way and how long it could last. The Coinshares study also notes that since the inception of the Bitcoin network, data shows “the relationship between bitcoin and inflation is currently better than between inflation and gold.” “There is increasing evidence that bitcoin is maturing as an asset,” Butterfill’s research concludes. “After the most recent FOMC statement (16th June) where an unexpectedly hawkish tone was expressed, prices moved in a very similar way to gold. This is highlighting that bitcoin is behaving as investors would expect from a real asset, by appreciating when the U.S. dollar declines and vice versa.” As Butterfill’s report highlights, it’s difficult to know or predict what the global economy will do. What makes it much worse is how unpredictable the Fed’s monetary system — with its never-ending rallies and busts — can be. Even though bankers and bureaucrats continuously tout that inflation is only 2% to 2.24%, the surging value of goods and services highlights the fact that 2% inflation is a myth.  In contrast to unpredictable monetary expansion, tightening, and mythical inflation rates, Bitcoin’s inflation rate per annum is only 1.77%. Central banks and politicians have always leveraged a 2% target reference, but data from web portals like shadowstats.com and equipmentradar.com, clearly shows the general increase in prices for goods and services is much higher than 2%. Unlike the Fed’s system, Bitcoin’s inflation rate per annum shrinks every four years during the reward halvings. Satoshi’s idea of an active supply coupled with demand and the reward rate decreasing every four years developed a predictable economic system with an inflationary rate no one can control. We can actually predict with rough estimates how much lower Bitcoin’s inflation rate per annum will be in the future. By 2025, it’s estimated that Bitcoin’s inflation will be lower than 1% and by 2028 the network’s inflation rate per annum will be 0.4%.

Hanke doesn’t think it’s a good idea for the Latin American country to use bitcoin as legal tender and says it could “completely collapse the economy.” The American economist Steve Hanke knows a lot about currencies, as he is the Cato Institute’s senior fellow and director of the Troubled Currencies Project. Hanke also was the senior economist during the Reagan administration from 1981 to 1982. The economist is critical of central banking and noted in 2018 that the world could use less of them. At the time, Hanke highlighted ten countries that are suffering from hyperinflation and the economist proposed that the countries either adopt the U.S. dollar or create a currency board. “Countries that employed currency boards have delivered lower inflation rates, smaller fiscal deficits, lower debt levels relative to the gross domestic product, fewer banking crises, and higher real growth rates than comparable countries that have employed central banks,” Hanke said at the time. Fast forward to three years later, Hanke is now discussing bitcoin (BTC) and the implications of widespread adoption. Hanke is not a fan of bitcoin and has mentioned this fact on numerous occasions. This past April, Hanke tweeted: “Bitcoin bulls hate to discuss the flaws of bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are the future of money. Bitcoin is not.” The economist also shared an article he wrote, which stresses the use of currency boards over bitcoin. In the article, Hanke talks about the monetary luminary Milton Friedman and Hanke also said he believes bitcoin comes with a “fundamental value of zero.” Hanke is once again attacking bitcoin after finding out that El Salvador would be leveraging bitcoin as legal tender in the Latin American country. Hanke thinks that nations like China or Russia could use El Salvador to cash out and remove USD from the equation. “It has the potential to completely collapse the economy because all the dollars in El Salvador could be vacuumed up, and there’d be no money in the country. They don’t have a domestic currency. You’re not going to pay for your taxi ride with a Bitcoin. It’s ridiculous […] You’ve got 70% of the people in El Salvador don’t even have bank accounts, Hanke stressed during an interview with Kitco’s David Lin. Hanke continued: The big problem with cryptos, in general, is that you can’t convert them into actual real legal tender that’s usable cheaply, and quickly. You can’t Bitcoin, for example, cheaply and easily convert into U.S. dollars. Following the economists’ statements with Kitco’s David Lin, Hanke also shared an article on Twitter written by Bitcoin.com News author Terence Zimwara. The article explains how the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has been discussing the country leveraging a digital currency by the year’s end. Hanke did not like this assessment from the CBN and said if it was like El Salvador’s idea, it would likely lead to ruin. Hanke tweeted: If Nigeria’s plans for a digital currency is anything like El Salvador’s Bitcoin plan, it will FAIL. Instead of toying with nutty ideas, Nigeria needs to establish a USD-denominated Currency Board, like the one it had between 1913-1959. Zimbabwean fintech lawyer and crypto proponent Prosper Mwedzi responded to Hanke’s statement about Nigeria and said: “I think a digital currency for Nigeria could improve bc access to financial services depending on [the] design.” Further, a number of others disagreed with Hanke’s commentary and replied to his scathing Nigeria/bitcoin tweet. “Hanke only has a hammer (USD Currency Board) so to him, everything looks like a nail,” another individual wrote. “Bitcoin has no such restrictions and will keep saving weak economies,” the person added.

A quick poll conducted by Camarasal, one of the biggest entrepreneur groups in El Salvador, is showing people have deep concerns about the future application of the Bitcoin Law. The poll got more than 1,600 answers in just four days from entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs. Camarasal president Jorge Hasbún stated on the massive participation that: We believe that this excellent response is a reflection of how urgent this issue is for Salvadorans, in the sense of the implications it will have for the family economy on a day-to-day basis. More than 96% of the entrepreneurs polled prefer an optional use of bitcoin for payments. The bitcoin tender law forces entrepreneurs to accept bitcoin for payments, as long as the entrepreneur manages the technological infrastructure to do so. In the same way, 45.3% indicated they were concerned that the circulation of cryptocurrency in the country is mandatory; while 35.9% assured that it generates mistrust. Also, most of the entrepreneurs won’t keep the bitcoin received as payment for their goods and services: 51.6% of them answered they would exchange the bitcoin received for dollars. Bitcoin is a pretty volatile asset too, and that scares entrepreneurs that work with tight margins. Camarasal also polled non-entrepreneurs, but the answers were not optimistic either. About using bitcoin as a medium of exchange, 36% said they are concerned and 39% said they distrusted it. The topic of wages and remittances was also included in the poll. El Salvador is a remittance-intensive country, with 23% of the GDP coming from these, according to AP. 93.2% said that they do not want to receive their salary in cryptocurrency, while 82.5% assured that they are not interested in receiving remittances in bitcoin. Salvadoreans are still lack training on bitcoin and its management, and that might be the key behind these unoptimistic answers. Camarasal vicepresident Carmen Alas stated: It will be essential that there is a broad consultation with an interdisciplinary group that represents the sectors involved for the construction of the regulations that make this law operational What do you think about Camarasal’s latest poll in El Salvador?

Moreover, most fund managers believe bitcoin is in a bubble and agree with the Fed that inflation is transitory. Bank of America (BofA) released its June Global Fund Manager Survey this week. The survey, conducted between June 4-10, covers 224 fund managers with $667 billion under management. The fund managers were asked about many issues of concern to investors, ranging from where the economy and markets are heading to how much cash portfolio managers are holding and which trades they see as most overdone. “Long commodities” is now the most crowded trade, overtaking “long bitcoin” which is now the second most crowded trade. The third most crowded trade is “long tech stock,” followed by “long ESG,” “short U.S. Treasuries,” and “long euro.”  Despite the BTC price pullback, 81% of the fund managers surveyed still think that bitcoin is in a bubble. This is a slight increase from May when 75% of the fund managers surveyed said bitcoin was in a bubble zone. Bank of America itself has also warned about the cryptocurrency being in a bubble. The bank’s chief investment strategist said in January bitcoin was “the mother of all bubbles.” Meanwhile, 72% of fund managers say that inflation is transitory, agreeing with what the Fed has been saying. However, 23% think inflation is permanent. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has used the word “transitory” to describe the threat of inflation to the U.S. economy several times. Nonetheless, a number of people have indicated that they disagree with him, including famed hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.

Following negative statements about bitcoin from U.S. senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts, the Republican senator from Texas, Ted Cruz, gave his opinion about bitcoin this week. Cruz appeared on the Fox News television show Hannity with the conservative host Sean Hannity. The Texas senator had a lot to say about Joe Biden and explained that he thinks the Biden administration is undermining the American economy and foreign policy. “If you look at Biden’s foreign policy and you break the world into two groups, our friends and our enemies,” Cruz said during the interview with Hannity, “What does Biden do? He undermines and weakens our friends systematically over and over and over again.” In addition to discussing foreign policy, Russia, and Nord Stream 2, the conversation turned to cryptocurrencies. “Okay, you’ve been hearing all about it,” says Sean Hannity. “Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, what is it? Why is it so big? What is Bitcoin? What is blockchain? What is doggy coin?” Hannity asked. The host of the Fox News broadcast further said that he’s been “studying this and debating this with friends for probably hundreds of hours,” in regard to crypto assets. The political commentator also added that he is “not in any way offering financial advice.” Senator Cruz also talked about bitcoin and noted that he believes the crypto asset is seeing mass adoption because people are frightened about rising inflation and the Biden administration’s proposed spending. “I think part of the reason we’re seeing people go to Bitcoin is because we’re on the verge of an inflation crisis and Joe Biden has proposed seven trillion dollars in new spending,” Cruz stressed during the interview. “We’re seeing inflation, which we’re seeing lumber going up, homes going up, oil going up, gasoline going up, energy going up, commodities going up.

Novogratz made these comments a few days after former U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo suggested that the United States is not going to have a digital dollar anytime soon. Still, Novogratz tells an interviewer that the United States’ success on this front will be dependent on the way the country manages its fiscal and monetary policies. He said: If our fiscal and monetary policy starts looking like it is from a Banana Republic…you are going to run into some Minsky moment where confidence breaks down. According to the report, a Minsky moment, which was espoused by the late Hyman Minsky, suggests “that a period of distortions in the financial system eventually ends very badly.” The U.S. has injected trillions of dollars into its economy and reports suggest more spending is being planned. However, some investors now fear this massive spending will cause the country’s inflation rate to rise. In the meantime, Novogratz also took time to push back against Peter Thiel’s recent claims that bitcoin is being used as a financial weapon by China. According to Novogratz, there is “zero evidence of the Chinese government buying bitcoin.” Further, the CEO dismisses Thiel as someone who “likes to say things that are provocative.” As reported by Bitcoin.com News, Thiel suggested at a recent seminar that China was using bitcoin’s reserve currency status to undermine the U.S. In addition to bitcoin, other critics also point to China’s rollout of the digital yuan as another way the Asian country is planning to “compete with the U.S. and other major developed economies.” What do you think about bitcoin bull and billionaire Mike Novogratz’s opinion about the digital dollar and a possible “existential crisis?” Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.}\", metadata={'source': '452020', 'row': 355, 'date': '2021-04-12 04:30:01', 'categories': 'Economics'}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"id: 450277\\ncontent: { 'news_date:'2021-03-31 20:30:37, 'news_cateogry: Economics 'news_content': The popular safe-haven asset gold recently posted the lowest settlement in three weeks, as a firm dollar and bond market yields have weakened support for the precious metal.

However, the precious metal (PM) gold has seen better days, as gold prices have retreated during the last few weeks. The price of gold dropped under the $1,700 per ounce range last week but today, the PM has managed to climb back above the psychological price zone. At the time of publication, an ounce of .999 fine gold is trading for $1,716.30 after jumping 1.7% in the last 24 hours. Gold bugs and economists have been discussing Joe Biden’s proposed $3 trillion stimulus package, and it could kickstart gold, silver, and other types of assets that are considered a hedge against inflation. Kitco Metals’ Jim Wyckoff said the dollar’s recent rise and the crazy Treasury yields “are limiting buying interest.”  “The gold and silver market bulls need a fundamental spark,” Kitco Metals senior analyst stressed. Wyckoff also noted that the top two PMs, gold and silver, saw “technically-related selling pressure from the shorter-term futures traders amid still-bearish near-term charts.” Meanwhile as gold has been in a slump, cryptocurrency markets have seen some fresh fervor after prices dropped from highs settled on March 13, 2021.

Several factors may be behind this development, but it could be bullish for the bitcoin price outlook no matter the catalyst. As bitcoin gradually matures and the ecosystem surrounding it expands further, the original cryptocurrency is increasingly behaving like a commodity. Thanks to a robust futures market that continues to grow, derivatives contracts on bitcoin also gain popularity and meaningfully impact its pricing structure. This has resulted in a unique development that has unfolded over the last several months. Known as “contango,” bitcoin futures contracts to be settled months down the road are trading at a significant premium to spot prices. This delivers a serious arbitrage opportunity that could temporarily result in relatively high returns with minimal risk. In more traditional financial markets, primarily for commodity futures contracts, the future pricing structure can vary dramatically compared to that commodity’s spot price. One of the most common examples of contango involves oil prices. Let’s say that spot oil is trading at $50 a barrel, and a contract due in three months is trading at $55 a barrel. This $5 delta (the difference between the futures price and spot price) represents a chance for traders to capture most of that $5 delta by selling (shorting) the futures contract at $55 a barrel and buying oil in the spot market for $50 a barrel simultaneously. Futures prices are higher than spot prices can be attributed to several factors, but this pricing scenario is called “contango”. For instance, some market analysts may believe that future demand will be higher than current demand, resulting in traders pushing up prices in the future compared to today’s prices. In other cases, analysts may believe that supply is set to fall in the future, creating a shortage that can also cause costs to rise in the future relative to the present. Other factors influence contango trades and diminish their profitability in traditional markets, among them being storage costs. In the oil example, selling futures contracts might require the seller to physically deliver the oil to the buyer at contract settlement. In the case of contango, it would require a trader to take physical possession of the oil bought in the spot market today to deliver against the short futures contract set to expire in a few months. This means the trader must store the oil over that period to capture the price differential, creating costs that eat away at the $5 difference between spot and futures prices. However, unlike oil, other energy commodities, metals, or agricultural products, bitcoin has no storage costs, whether we are discussing 1 bitcoin to 10,000 bitcoins.         \\nA Risk-Free Cryptocurrency Trade\\nBitcoin futures turnover accounts for a significant amount of daily cryptocurrency volume. According to Skew’s figures, futures volume surpassed $50 billion almost every day for the last four weeks after reaching a whopping $184 billion on February 23rd.\\nConcerning contango, futures prices are trading steeply above spot prices, in some instances to the tune of 15% to 20%.

Three days ago, Bitcoin.com reported on a poll that was published by the Japanese banking firm Mizuho Securities. The study polled 235 individuals who make less than $150,000 annually. The survey’s responses had shown that $40 billion out of the $380 billion in direct stimulus would go toward bitcoin and stocks. $24 billion out of the aggregate or 60% would possibly flow into bitcoin (BTC), Mizuho’s survey noted. Now a new survey has been published by the Harris Poll, otherwise known as Harris Insights, which claims 1 in 10 U.S. citizens have used their stimulus checks to invest in cryptocurrencies.  The Harris Poll American market research and analytics company is a reputable pollster that was created back in 1963. The company has monitored the sentiment, behaviors, and motivations of U.S.-based adults for 56 years. The survey that shows a tenth of Americans who are eligible for stimulus will buy bitcoin (BTC) or ethereum (ETH) was recorded on March 12-15, 2021. Yahoo Finance also participated in the poll which is also 4x times larger than the Mizuho survey as the Harris Poll surveyed 1,052 Americans ages 18 and older. The survey results say: A recent study finds that about 15% of Americans who received the last two stimulus checks invested part or all of the money from those checks, and about half of this group invested specifically in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum. There’s been an uptick of those willing to invest in cryptocurrencies since the last two stimulus checks. More are willing to toss the money at “experimental investing” and it coincides with the increasing number of Americans spending stimulus on non-essentials, the Harris Poll survey notes. Three significant trends were noticed, the increasing of Americans hoarding the funds in savings for a rainy day, investing funds in cryptos like BTC and ETH, and non-essential spending habits such as purchasing entertainment and electronics. 52% of the Americans surveyed said that compared to before the Covid-19 pandemic, household finances have not changed. One in five participants said that their economic situation has improved in comparison to before the pandemic hit. 29% detail that their financial situations have worsened since the initial Covid-19 outbreak. The biggest spending trends included necessities like rent, mortgages, and groceries (43%), while 36% put the money aside for savings. A grand total of 15% used the money to invest in things like stocks and crypto-assets. Crypto asset investments with stimulus money accounted for 7% of the survey responses. “It’s clear, though, that right now, getting back to spending is not the sole focus for Americans,” the Harris Poll author details. “Although most of those who expect to receive the next stimulus payment do see themselves in need, a large plurality plan to put at least some of the money into their savings (40%) or invest the funds (17%). Of those who plan to invest money from the new stimulus check, 41% plan to invest in cryptocurrencies,” the Harris Insights survey emphasizes. The survey says a “small uptick in the willingness” to spend on non-essentials is clear and this has increased since the first two rounds of stimulus checks. For instance, 10% spent their first stimulus on non-essentials like investing, entertainment, and electronics devices. The second stimulus checks saw a rise to 13% and the latest Harris Poll shows 16% of those eligible for the third round of stimulus payments, “plan to spend part or all of the money on non-essentials.

Glassnode analyst, Rafael Schultze-Kraft, explains the difference between long-term holders and short-term holders in order to analyze the behaviors of these types of investors. Ever since bitcoin (BTC) touched an all-time high at $61,782 per unit market prices have been a bit more tumultuous. Currently, BTC is hovering just above the $55k handle and it happened awfully close to the anniversary of March 12, 2020, when Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio dropped to 0.88.  Basically an MVRV is a calculation that divides market value by realized value every day. It can give someone a sense of what the “fair value” just might be when looking at the two combined. Researchers from Coinmetrics show that after the MVRV ratio dropped to 0.88 on ‘Black Thursday‘ 2020 (March 12), one year later the MVRV has improved. “On March 12th, 2021 it closed at $57,335, a gain of over 10x (1,000%),” explains Nate Maddrey and the Coin Metrics’ team. Prior to March 12, 2020’s one-year anniversary, Glassnode’s cofounder and CTO, Rafael Schultze-Kraft, published a report called “Breaking up Onchain Metrics for Short and Long Term Investors.” In the report, Schultze-Kraft introduces new variations of the SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) and the MVRV ratio, in order to assess long-term holders (LTH) and short-term holders (STH). As MVRV calculates the divide between market value and realized value, SOPR is an indicator for observing loss and profits. “The SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) indicator acts as a proxy for overall market profit and loss,” a study guide published by Glassnode Academy notes.  The study published by Schultze-Kraft shows how the new variations can categorize bitcoin (BTC) by assessing holding behaviors. Glassnode’s research notes that other studies have tried to assess holding behaviors like Spent Output Age Bands, HODL waves, and Bitcoin Dormancy figures. The new variations Schultze-Kraft says helps researchers identify industry stakeholders. “Our approach is to break up onchain activity according to two major industry stakeholders: Short Term Holders (STH) and Long Term Holders (LTH),” Schultze-Kraft writes. “We categorise these two investor types using information on coin age.” This data gives the researchers statistics on the number of bitcoins that have not moved since a certain date. The report further notes that LTH bitcoins represent a great number of UTXOs: Around 37% (~7 million) of the existing Bitcoin supply hasn’t moved since the last ATH in December 2017. Similarly, more than half of circulating bitcoins (55%) have not moved since the market bottom in late 2018 more than a year ago. Clearly, these numbers illustrate that there is a substantial amount of investors committed to hodl over long periods of time, i.e. Long Term Holders (LTH). On the opposite side of the spectrum, Glassnode highlights that onchain transaction volume accounts for 1 million BTC per day. Schultze-Kraft highlights that the researchers can infer that “to a large extent it is the same set of coins that are being transferred in the network over and over again.” Furthermore, by observing historical UTXO movements, Glassnode can calculate the “probability of a UTXO being spent as a function of its age/lifespan.” “Thus, our assumption is that if a UTXO exceeds a certain lifespan threshold in the ballpark of 100–200 days, those coins are in the hands of market players that are less prone to speculate and trade based on short timeframes\\u200a—\\u200aLong Term Holders,” the study notes. “Conversely,” the study adds. “UTXOs that are spent earlier, are owned by Short Term Holders.” When defining LTH and STH data based on age Schultze-Kraft writes that a minimum of 155 days is considered a Long Term Holder (LTH). Meanwhile, “Short Term Holders (STH) are defined by all UTXOs with a lifespan of less than 155 days,” Glassnode’s “Breaking up Onchain Metrics” study suggests.

As Bitcoin price performance continues to impress, it becomes increasingly important to assess how different market participants are reacting to elevated prices,” Glassnode details. “Conversely, once a coin passes our 155 day threshold to become a LTH held coin, it is increasingly unlikely to be spent on a statistical basis, often only coming back to life during volatility and at higher prices in bullish markets,” Glassnode analyst Schultze-Kraft’s report emphasizes.

On Monday, the chief strategy officer for the Human Rights Foundation, Alex Gladstein, explained that 1.2 billion global citizens are living under inflation rates as high as two to three-digits.  During the last week, a number of analysts and economists have been discussing the possible inflation rise coming to the U.S., mostly because of the massive amounts of stimulus created in 2020 and 2021. It has led economists to believe that inflation is coming to the U.S. soon, as the Federal Reserve is backed into a corner with plans to keep the easy-money schemes going strong. Inflation is the depletion of a currency’s purchasing power paired against goods and services over time. Inflation can be measured by observing the currency’s purchasing power over a period of recorded time.  For instance, an inflation calculator will tell an American how much the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power has lost since 1913, the very year the Federal Reserve was created. According to data, if a person spent $20 on an item back in 1913, the same service, product, or item will cost $528.45 today. That’s a cumulative rate of inflation of 2542.2% over the course of 107 years. But the U.S. inflation rate per annum is allegedly only 1.50%, according to 2021 data stemming from worldpopulationreview.com. The UK’s inflation rate is roughly the same as the United States according to current stats as well. The rate of inflation in the U.S. is paltry compared to many other countries worldwide. The chief strategy officer for the Human Rights Foundation, Alex Gladstein highlighted this issue on Monday in a series of tweets. Gladstein is also a bitcoin (BTC) proponent and has been an evangelist for the leading crypto asset for quite some time. “Many might think that extreme inflation is a rare occurrence in today’s modern world,” Gladstein said to his 27,000 Twitter followers on Monday. “That’s simply not the case. There are 1.2 billion people currently living in countries experiencing double or triple-digit inflation,” Gladstein insisted. Then the Human Rights Foundation (HRF) team member rattled off 11 countries with inflation ranging from 10% – 20%. He included Haiti, Nigeria, Turkey, Sierra Leone, Uzbekistan, Guinea, Liberia, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Ghana, and Tajikistan. The HRF member’s stats can be compared to worldpopulationreview.com’s inflation rates by country 2021 list. Additionally, Gladstein listed ten countries “with inflation north of 20%.” Gladstein wrote that this list includes Ethiopia, Zambia, Libya, Congo, Angola, Yemen, South Sudan, Argentina, North Korea, and Cuba. Gladstein further tweeted six countries that have inflation rates north of 50%. The six countries the HRF member listed include: “It is hard to get good inflation data for most countries,” Gladstein added. “This analysis was done comparing a handful of the top sources. Some vary significantly. Additional countries are going through revolutions/coups and are experiencing currency shocks, but fresh data is hard to find,” the HRF chief strategy officer said. Gladstein insists that it is “clear that some [governments] fabricate economic data and that things on the ground are far worse than what they report.” Gladstein concluded: Either way, in sum, there are more than a billion people whose currency is quickly shrinking in value. Many have already found an escape in Bitcoin. Comparing Gladstein’s analysis on Twitter to the data stemming from worldpopulationreview.com stats and a number of other currency inflation aggregators shows that his data is solid. It means that the 1.2 billion inhabitants on earth are seeing their purchasing power erode much faster than in the U.S. or in Europe. The diminishing purchasing power in these countries has forced global citizens to find safety from inflation. Comparing the fact that many of these countries with inflation rates north of 20% to even 50% are seeing bitcoin (BTC) prices reach all-time highs and even global premiums, shows demand for BTC is much higher in these regions.

The strong momentum has a number of crypto enthusiasts thinking that bitcoin prices reaching the $100k to $288k range by the year’s end is possible. Plan B’s stock-to-flow model otherwise known as (S2F or S2FX) is a popular chart that measures the existing number of BTC in circulation (stock) and pairs it against the number of issued coins minted during mining (flow). To many crypto enthusiasts, the S2F model so far has been fairly consistent and following along the mapped trajectory Plan B and others have estimated. In November 2020, the S2F creator doubled down and told the public that there was “no doubt whatsoever” in his mind that his S2F model was “correct.” At the time, Plan B said that he predicts the price of BTC will “tap $100K-288K before [December] 2021. In fact, I have new data that confirms the supply shortage is real,” he added. On March 1, 2021, Plan B revealed that the S2F model was still working and the price of BTC was actually 26% above the model’s predicted trajectory. “New orange dot,” Plan B tweeted. “Feb close $45,240 (Jan was $33,141 and current price is $46,500)… like clockwork.” Two days later, Plan B wrote that ever since he drafted the model back in 2019 the prediction has been on point. He said: Bitcoin S2F model was published in March 2019. The model’s out-of-sample performance (on new data after Feb 2019) has been spot on. In another tweet on Wednesday, Plan B criticized the S&P 500. “My most hated chart about bitcoin,” he said, sharing a correlation technical analysis chart. “S&P 500 correlation… S&P $4K and BTC $100K soon?” Plan B asked. On February 26, the S2F author also held a poll on Twitter and the survey received 53,860 votes. Plan B’s Twitter survey poll asked: “Do you think bitcoin will reach $500K, $288K (S2FX model) or $100K (S2Fv2 model) before December 2021 .. or will BTC stay below $100K?”  The poll had shown that 37.3% or the majority of participants think BTC will reach $100k. A touch less 33.1% thinks that $288k BTC prices are actually possible. 18.9% of the votes say that BTC will remain under the $100k handle and 10.7% voted BTC could reach $500k per unit. During the last week, a number of bitcoiners have also been congratulating Plan B for his S2F predictions seemingly coming to fruition. “Stock to flow, quite incredible to see it play out,” one trader said and called Plan B a legend. Although, there’s plenty of S2F naysayers who have criticized Plan B’s stock-to-flow model in the past, but in more recent days S2F haters have been quieter. Despite the critics, Plan B still seems extremely confident about his prediction and the S2F model as he noted on February 20, 2021, that the price of BTC reached the $55k target that he predicted in March 2019. “$55k feels very natural and even low now, but back in early 2019 people laughed at [CNBC’s Joe Kernen] for just mentioning the possibility of $55k BTC,” Plan B tweeted that day. The S2F model’s creator also mentioned that the Wall Street Journal also noted that Plan B’s S2F model was on track as it completed the $55k zone last month.

One thing’s for certain, wages have not increased, no matter the common denominator people use to measure today’s salaries. Pal wholeheartedly believes that bitcoin is the only “life raft” he knows of that has “the optionality to change this [issue] over time.” Raoul Pal is a bitcoin bull and he’s said many times that the decentralized crypto asset is extremely “hard money.” This week on Twitter, Pal discussed a few denominators people leverage to measure things in economics. He asked his social media followers whether or not they thought we had the wrong denominator. “Many of us believe that Fed money printing is creating an asset bubble. But when we switch the denominator to the Fed balance sheet equities look fairly priced,” Pal’s thread noted. When we look at SPX vs M2, the other measure people look at, equities are expensive but not wildly so…(it’s sort of just earning growth). Gold has done less well but ok (sort of [like] equities minus the earning growth),” Pal said. As far as gold versus the M2, the entrepreneur says that the denominator has held its ground. M2 is the term used for a broad calculation of the easily convertible (liquid) money supply which includes checking deposits and cash. SPX versus gold is 60% above its 100-year average Pal said and in his view, “gold is the best long-term denominator for assets.” Pal then said maybe a devaluation of the denominator is the real issue at hand. “We think of it as the [Federal Reserve] creating bubbles, but maybe it’s all fairly priced considering the change in [the] value of the denominator? Much like Venz equities rise when the currency devalues,” Pal stated. “However, the situation is much worse when you look at wages, which have barely moved in 50 years in real terms, underperforming all assets massive due to massive demographic bulges, globalisation, and technology,” he added. In the United States, all wages have outperformed things like cars, trucks, and oil, but when the common denominator is gold it looks inferior. “Another way is [to] look at how many hours [of] work it takes to buy an ounce of gold… Wages allow you no investment opportunity,” the Global Macro Investor executive emphasized. Purchasing equities is a joke as well said Pal because the median person gets to buy next to zero. People have lost 90% of their purchasing power when it comes to buying property he stressed. Pal continued: And that explains the rise in debt – Households added to maintain purchasing power… This is a theme BTC market participants picked up a long time ago. BTC has massively outperformed both M2 and the Fed balance sheet. You could interpret BTC as a bubble. You could suggest it hasn’t reached its full price discovery as many adopt it as their life raft as Metcalfe’s Law kicks in. Whatever the case may be Pal said, bitcoin (BTC) has dramatically offset “the wages/purchasing power/denominator issue.” He said that he thinks it is the only chance people have this day in age for someone to expand their economic horizons. “It is literally the only chance the median person has to change this dynamic,” Pal asserted. “Especially young people who are in huge competition for jobs with boomers and their own massive generation and with technology and workers around the world, struggling to survive too.” The Global Macro Investor executive thinks that the wage issue is forcing people to grow more upset and angry at the system. He noted that people feel poorer, they are poorer, they have more debt, and they need to obtain more debt, which is an “endless loop,” Pal stressed. “We do have a different solution – [Bitcoin] and digital assets in general. It is a whole new asset class, that has incredible future expected returns from adoption effects and use cases. It also has the chance to fix our broken finance system. It also offers massive rewards for entrepreneurs,” Raoul Pal said.As usual, Pal believes that bitcoin can help, as the average person is not included and the traditional financial system is growing less accessible. “The [average person] can’t own enough investments to make up for the difference,” he said. Pal concluded: It’s a poverty trap of the middle classes. Bitcoin is the only life raft I know of that has the optionality to change this over time. It will get overly speculative, it will burst but it will rise again. I don’t see many alternatives as most can’t be successful entrepreneurs or market wizards. They need something to invest in. Something with high expected future returns. Or they could lower their cost base via a safety net. Pal is extremely bullish about bitcoin’s future and for quite some time, the former Goldman Sachs executive said he’s been “irresponsibly long’ toward bitcoin. The macro strategist detailed at the time, that he was also short on the U.S. dollar. “My conviction levels in bitcoin rise every day. I’m already irresponsibly long,” he noted. Following those statements, Pal said he decided to allocate 10% of his company’s balance sheet toward holding bitcoin and sold all his gold reserves for a portfolio of BTC and ETH.

Forbes insists that money only works best if it has a stable value.  According to Forbes, cryptocurrencies can only challenge existing money if their value is tied to that of gold or the Swiss franc currency. In arguing his case against the idea that bitcoin will eventually replace the dollar, Forbes concedes, however, that the crypto is “now seen as a respectable investment class.” He adds that “financial institutions are adding it to their portfolios.” Explaining this shift towards bitcoin, Forbes says: People are piling in because of a lack of faith in government fiat currencies. The Federal Reserve and other central banks have crushed interest rates and are printing unimaginable amounts of money to pay for Covid relief measures and to stimulate damaged economies. According to the publisher, some of these steps, which are inflationary, could be the possible reasons why bitcoin has now “become the darling of investors.” Furthermore, Forbes also acknowledges that some enthusiasts do see bitcoin as “the new gold” while others believe it will “eventually replace the dollar.” Nevertheless, the thinks this is not about to happen because of how bitcoin’s volatility can potentially affect the contract system. The publisher uses the example of a housing mortgage loan to illustrate why cryptocurrencies cannot be used in contracts which he says “are essential for an economy.” Forbes explains: Say you took a mortgage in March for $250,000, today to you owe the bank almost $2 million.

However, the billionaire thinks the crypto will not replace fiat currency due to what he terms the high “energy cost required to process its transfers.” Galperin, who has an estimated net worth of $7.7 billion, made the remarks when responding to an inquiry from a Twitter user. The user wanted to know if the billionaire was a BTC holder as well as his opinion on the possibility of Argentina adopting cryptocurrencies.  Although Galperin dismisses the idea of cryptocurrencies actually replacing fiat currencies, he does, however, think that “quantum computing” can solve the challenge of high energy costs which he believes to afflict the Bitcoin network. However, the billionaire’s remarks about the bitcoin network energy costs prompted a response from bitcoiners. For instance, in their response to the billionaire’s tweet, one user going by the name Martín Morando agrees with the first part of Galperin’s comments. Nevertheless, the user is quick to explain to the billionaire that his understanding of bitcoin mining may not be correct. In his tweet, Morando says, “the energy cost is not a problem (but) it is part of the combo.” He adds that “most of the energy used is renewable.” The Twitter user then refers the billionaire to a website that debunks the theory that bitcoin mining is energy inefficient. On the other hand, another user Ibarra Gustavo poses a question to Galperin: In Mercado Libre and Mercado Pago have they measured how many k.w.h they consume to process money transfers with all credit card and Mercado Pago entities that operate? Still, other users like Matias Walkoski are skeptical of Galperin’s opinion that quantum computing will prove to be instrumental in hastening BTC adoption.

Data indicates that the analysts have classified 14.5 million bitcoin as illiquid and only 4.2 million bitcoin in constant circulation. One of the most treasured parts of the Bitcoin (BTC) protocol is the fact that the system is mathematically provable, and bitcoins are scarce. When Satoshi Nakamoto created the crypto asset, the inventor set the supply cap to end at 21 million coins issued and today, there’s approximately 18.58 million BTC in circulation. This week, researchers from the onchain analysis firm Glassnode reported on the number of liquid and illiquid coins in existence these days.  Despite the fact that exchanges have a massive quantity of bitcoin (BTC) on hand to sell and trade, Glassnode researchers say that 78% of the current supply is illiquid. On Twitter, Glassnode wrote: “78% of the circulating bitcoin supply is illiquid and therefore hardly accessible for buying. This points to a bullish investor sentiment as large amounts of BTC are being hoarded – which reduces sell pressure,” the researchers stressed. The analysts added: Bitcoin liquidity is defined as the average ratio of received and spent BTC across entities. We show that currently 14.5M BTC are classified as illiquid, leaving only 4.2M BTC in constant circulation that are available for buying and selling.  The onchain data suggests that the current uptrend in crypto asset value has been fueled by liquidity issues. For instance, during the course of the year, large financial institutions and well known hedge fund managers have been purchasing bitcoin in massive quantities. The bitcoin treasuries list has grown rapidly this year with 29 well known companies capturing 1.1 million BTC to be held for treasury reserves. “Over the course of 2020, a total of 1 million additional BTC have become illiquid— investors are increasingly hodling,” the Glassnode analysts further noted. The rising illiquidity suggests “the current bull run has been (partly) driven by this emerging bitcoin liquidity crisis,” the researchers added. Glassnode concluded that the amount of liquid and illiquid bitcoin in circulation has a “clear relationship with the BTC market.” Data shows that since 2017, the illiquid supply of bitcoin has swelled more so than the issued bitcoin stemming from bitcoin miners. This pattern was observed during the crypto asset runup in 2017 as well, the onchain researchers detailed. According to the Bituniverse “Exchange Transparent Balance Rank” data stemming from Peckshield, Etherscan, and Chain.info, exchanges hold fewer bitcoins than they did last year. Coinbase is the leading exchange, in terms of BTC reserves held, with 870,000 BTC on hand. This is followed by Huobi (252k BTC), Binance (215k BTC), Bitfinex (142k BTC), and Kraken (137k BTC).

Arcane Research detailed that charts showing the number of bitcoin leaving exchanges has seen a sharp decline and has been “one of the main stories of the year.” Meanwhile, onchain metrics indicate a number of older coins are being sold as bitcoin’s value increases. In 2020 there’s a lot of cryptocurrencies held on exchanges, however, the aggregate number of bitcoin (BTC) held on trading platforms has declined immensely this year. In fact, BTC held on exchanges haven’t been as low as they are today since 2018, according to onchain statistics by Glassnode. From January 2018 to February 2020, the aggregate total of BTC held on exchanges climbed. However, since February, bitcoin held on exchanges saw a 21.66% drop and remains at levels not seen in two years. On Tuesday, Arcane Research tweeted about the BTC leaving exchanges and shared a chart displaying the data captured by Glassnode. “One of the main stories of the year has been the sharp decline in the aggregated BTC exchange balance,” Arcane tweeted. “After moving sideways throughout November, the BTC exchange balance has once again started declining,” the researchers added. Data suggests that cryptocurrency owners might be leery of crypto exchanges after the recent Kucoin hack and withdrawal issues at Okex. While some people suggest that new buyers are becoming long-term holders and assume the self-custody trend will continue to drive demand. “Bitcoin exchange balances are falling at a rate practically unseen before in history,” the Youtuber Crypto Daily tweeted back in October. “This means fewer people are looking to short term speculate— Bullish.” While November levels remained stagnant, the BTC decline from exchanges picked up during the first week of December. In addition to the recent decline of BTC held in exchange reserves, onchain research shows that older coins are being sold as the price grows larger. “While this might seem alarming,” Glassnode’s Liesl Eichholz explained. “This trend has historically been extremely bullish.” Eichholz further detailed that the researchers leveraged the network’s bitcoin’s Entity-Adjusted ASOL (Average Spent Output Lifespan). The data provides a look at older coins being spent as BTC’s price increases and in late November, stats show long-term holders realized profits.  Despite what people might think, long-term holders (LTH) realizing profits at this stage in the game is not a bearish signal, according to the Glassnode contributor. “As a result of this trend, the total supply held by long-term holders usually decreases well before market tops – and accordingly, so does the total LTH supply in profit,” Eichholz writes. “The large decreases in total LTH supply seen above make intuitive sense; as these long-term holders realize profits, they leave room for new retail investors to enter the market, which has historically driven bitcoin’s largest bull markets.” In short, there seems to be a great number of people removing BTC off exchanges and some of these instances are most certainly new long-term holders, but how many is uncertain. In addition to that data, Glassnode’s report about existing LTH participants shows that many “habitually accumulate BTC in bear markets, and then realize their profits on the way up, but importantly before the top.” “If BTC’s price follows this historical trend, it indicates that we are in for further price increases before the top is reached,” Eichholz concluded.

The Indian investor began by recalling that when the coronavirus pandemic hit, the U.S. dollar was the world’s “reserve currency,” noting that it has been one for 100 years while other previous reserve currencies lasted about 94 years on average. “That would have been reason to question how much longer it could continue, but for one caveat: the lack of a successor,” Sharma described, noting some contenders that fall short, such as the euro or China’s renminbi. “US officials were thus confident that, in response to the Covid-19 lockdowns, they could print the dollar in limitless quantities without undermining its reserve currency status, allowing the country to keep running large deficits without apparent consequences,” the strategist continued, elaborating: But a new class of contenders is emerging: cryptocurrencies … cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are being pitched by their champions as decentralised, democratic alternatives. While pointing out that there are bitcoin skeptics, including those who prefer gold, Sharma said, “many people have bought bitcoin in bulk,” as they fear that “central banks led by the US Federal Reserve are debasing the value of their currencies.” This has boosted the price of bitcoin which has “more than quadrupled since March, making it one of the hottest investments of 2020.” He proceeded to describe that after decades of mounting, U.S. debts to the rest of the world surpassed 50% of its economic output last year, citing that this is “a threshold that often signals a coming crisis,” according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Sharma added that since then, those liabilities have spiked to 67% of output as the government continued to borrow heavily under lockdown. “The dollar’s reign is likely to end when the rest of the world starts losing confidence that the US can keep paying its bills. That is how dominant currencies fell in the past,” the strategist claimed, asserting: Bitcoin is also starting to make progress on its ambition to replace the dollar as a medium of exchange … Money printing is likely to continue, even when the pandemic passes. Trusted or not, bitcoin will gain from widening distrust in the traditional alternatives. Sharma believes that bitcoin is gaining mainstream acceptance. “Today, most bitcoins are held as an investment, not used to pay bills, but that is changing,” he opined, noting that small businesses are starting to use the cryptocurrency for international trade, “particularly in countries where dollars can be hard to come by (such as Nigeria) or the local currency is unstable (Argentina).” He further pointed out that large companies such as Paypal and its subsidiary Venmo are planning to allow 28 million merchants to accept bitcoin next year.         \\nSharma then warned governments that “Bitcoin’s surge may still prove to be a bubble, but even if it pops, this year’s rush to cryptocurrencies should serve as a warning to government money printers everywhere, particularly in the US.,” elaborating:\\nDo not assume that your traditional currencies are the only stores of value, or mediums of exchange, that people will ever trust. Tech-savvy people are not likely to stop looking for alternatives, until they find or invent one.\\nThe strategist concluded, “And stepping in to regulate the digital currency boom, as some governments are already considering, may only accelerate this populist revolt.”\\nDo you think bitcoin will replace the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency?

At the end of August, the Mediterranean restaurant chain Tahini’s announced the Canadian company converted all of their cash reserves into bitcoin. On Friday, Tahini’s tweeted about the recent crypto reserve conversion, as the team recalled telling the firm’s financial advisor that the precious metal gold and it’s years of being a reliable safe haven are numbered. This year, a great number of private and publicly listed companies have been gathering vast amounts of bitcoin (BTC) and storing the crypto asset as a form of reserve status. For instance, the web portal bitcointreasuries.org shows 23 companies that are holding bitcoin as a reserve. The close to two dozen firms listed hold approximately 888,864 BTC worth over $15 billion or 4.23% of the supply. Back in August, after Microstrategy announced its initial purchase, the Canada-based Mediterranean restaurant establishment Tahini’s announced it converted all of its cash reserves into bitcoin (BTC). “We just converted our entire cash reserves that were originally used as savings into bitcoin,” Tahini’s revealed at the time. On Friday, the restaurant chain’s official Twitter account told the public why it decided to choose bitcoin in contrast to choosing the precious metal gold as a safe haven. “We looked our financial advisor in the eye and told him gold will turn into a scam because of bitcoin,” the company tweeted on Friday. “He laughed and condescendingly came back with the 6,000 years argument,” Tahini’s added. The restaurant owners decided to further explain why the company thinks “gold’s years are numbered.” Tahini’s concedes that gold has been a store-of-value for a very long time and used in jewelry. Then the Twitter account noted that individuals in the gold sales industry like Peter Schiff “will lie to you and tell you that gold’s value comes from practical use cases like electronics,” Tahini’s said. “Gold does get used for other things besides a store of value, but that demand is not what gives gold a $10 trillion dollar market cap,” the Canadian restaurant owners insisted.  Instead, Tahini’s believes that large countries and institutions hoarding gold in vaults is what has been giving gold long term value. For millennia this has worked Tahini’s said because “gold was always the scarcest asset with the highest Stock/Flow ratio.” However, Tahini’s stressed that “Bitcoin changed that.” Tahini’s opinion is that bitcoin is “1,000x better than gold in all aspects” and gives 14 reasons why the firm thinks the crypto asset is better. For one, unlike gold, bitcoin is “100% monetary premium which means it is not used for electronics or any other use cases other than pure money.” “Bitcoin dematerializes value and makes it digital which made it easier to move value across the world without the need for any third parties,” the company wrote. “We can move $100 million from Canada to the UK to Australia and back to Canada in 2 hours for 30 bucks max. To do that with gold you will need an armed security team and [it] will cost you from 300 to 500 thousand dollars [and] take [four] to [five] months,” Tahini’s added.  The restaurant owners further said that because gold is so heavy, some countries like Venezuela store their gold elsewhere and risk it being confiscated. Tahini’s wrote that even common citizens will go to great lengths to smuggle gold and illustrated their point by referring to a man who got caught storing gold bullion in his rectum recently. “Gold is scarce but bitcoin is absolutely scarce— A very important differentiation,” the company said. “Gold miners currently mine 2% of the gold supply every year. The higher the price of gold goes, the more resources will be spent on trying to mine more gold— Just like oil.” In the future, Tahini’s expects gold mining technology to improve and in contrast, bitcoin’s supply issuance is fixed and has a difficulty adjustment. The company concluded with a few more reasons why BTC was better than gold, and further noted that precious metals investors can “easily be surprised that a discovery of a new gold mine will soon flood the market.” During Tahini’s summary of gold versus bitcoin, the company also said that it disagreed with investors like Dan Tapiero, Paul Tudor Jones, and Stan Druckenmiller that “think gold and bitcoin are cousins.” “Bitcoin’s supply is verifiable to the last 1/100millionth unit simply by running a full node on your laptop,” Tahini’s determined in its Twitter thread. “While gold bugs will tell you that gold scarce— There is no accurate way of verifying that scarcity to the last ounce.” What do you think about the Canada-based Middle Eastern restaurant chain Tahini’s opinion that bitcoin is 1000x superior to gold?

The founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, now says that bitcoin “could serve as a diversifier to gold and other such storehold of wealth assets.” Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, who has long been skeptical about bitcoin, now says that the cryptocurrency has a place in investment portfolios. In a Reddit AMA on Tuesday, Dalio clarified his view about bitcoin. The American billionaire hedge fund manager founded Bridgewater Associates and has served as its co-chief investment officer since 1985. With about $140 billion in assets under management, his hedge fund is the largest in the world. AICIO Magazine and Wired Magazine have called Dalio the “Steve Jobs of Investing,” and TIME Magazine has named him one of the 100 Most Influential People. Last month, Dalio tweeted that he “might be missing something about bitcoin,” and would “love to be corrected.” However, at that time, he was still unconvinced about the cryptocurrency, raising several key concerns, which bitcoiners quickly debunked. Many Reddit users asked Dalio about bitcoin during the AMA, including user Nassimtalebiscoolleb, a self-proclaimed fan of American economist and trader Nassim Taleb. “I think it’s clear that the inequality in this country has gotten too rampant and we have lost our ways as a capitalist nation. I believe you recognize that central bank stimulus has played a big role in this,” he began. “Is bitcoin a potential answer to this issue that the global new world fiat monetary system has caused?” Dalio wrote in response, “I think that bitcoin (and some other digital currencies) have over the last ten years established themselves as interesting gold-like asset alternatives, with similarities and differences to gold and other limited-supply, mobile (unlike real estate) storeholds of wealth,” elaborating: It could serve as a diversifier to gold and other such storehold of wealth assets. The main thing is to have some of these type of assets (with limited supply, that are mobile, and that are storeholds of wealth), including stocks, in one’s portfolio and to diversify among them.         \\nThe billionaire fund manager added that “Not enough people do that.” Nonetheless, he maintained: “As for bitcoin relative to gold, I have a strong preference for holding those things which central banks are going to want to hold and exchange value in when they are trying to transact.”\\nA slew of hedge fund managers have recently become more bullish about bitcoin, including Paul Tudor Jones, Bill Miller, and Stan Druckenmiller.

Led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the strategists noted the declining inflow of funds allocated to gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since October, as flows into bitcoin (BTC) funds have swelled almost simultaneously. They said that the move “represents the transfer of billions in cash.” “The adoption of bitcoin by institutional investors has only begun, while for gold its adoption by institutional investors is very advanced,” Panigirtzoglou said, in a Bloomberg report on Dec. 9, adding: If this medium to longer-term thesis proves right, the price of gold would suffer from a structural headwind over the coming years. To illustrate the point, JPMorgan looked at the performance of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, a publicly listed security widely used by institutional investors. Since October, said the bank, nearly $2 billion has poured into the Trust. That compares with outflows of $7 billion for gold-backed exchange-traded funds over the same period. JPMorgan suggested that one-way gold holders could play the coming onslaught is to buy one Grayscale unit and sell three units of the SPDR Gold Trust. It detailed that while bitcoin accounts only for 0.18% of family office assets, compared with 3.3% for gold ETFs, any small movement of funds from gold to BTC would “represent the transfer of billions in cash.” Wall Street financial barons that previously used all sorts of adjectives to discredit bitcoin have this year either started to rescind their past opinions or to pile into the top crypto, looking to hedge against inflation fuelled by coronavirus-induced stimulus spending. Notable investors like Paul Tudor Jones, Stan Druckenmiller, and Wall Street giants Guggenheim Partners have all moved money into bitcoin or are planning to do so. Blackrock CEO Laurence D. Fink, who in the past called bitcoin a money-laundering tool, now thinks the asset will grow into a global market. In its analysis, JPMorgan warned, however, that “there’s a good chance that bitcoin prices have overshot and gold is due for a recovery.” It said bitcoin prices have lost momentum, which could result in some selling pressure in the short-term. Bitcoin has tumbled by about 8% since reaching an all-time high of $19,864 on November 30. On Wednesday, the digital asset lost nearly $2,000 of its value in a precipitous decline to $17,600. At the time of writing, prices had recovered to around $18,277. What do you think about JPMorgan’s gold predictions?

This is in contrast to gold which appears to perform better when real interest rates are falling while inflation is rising.  To support these findings, the report points to the collapse of the gold price in Q2 of 2013, after the US Federal Reserve signalled it would raise rates in the future. During that period bitcoin value surged. In fact, the report asserts “that 2013 was bitcoin’s best-ever year (5400%) and gold’s worst year (-28%) since 1981.”  Explaining bitcoin’s relationship with other assets, one of the report’s co-authors, Charlie Morris, Co-Founder and Chief Investment Officer at Bytetree, says because it (bitcoin) is “responsive to monetary conditions, it is naturally correlated with risk-on assets, including equities and credit.” Morris references the year 2013, which he says was a specular year for social media stocks (62%) “which supports my view that bitcoin is a growth asset.”  Gold, on the other hand, “thrives on falling real interest rates, rather than central bank stimulus, because it has a strong link to inflation.” Morris adds: “Hypothetically, when interest rates are falling, and inflation is rising, that is the perfect storm for gold. Conversely, tight money occurs when rates rise faster than inflation; a condition that is devastating for gold.” The report concludes that “notwithstanding the shared love of stimulus and an inverse reaction to the dollar, gold and Bitcoin are more opposite than alike.” Still, the report talks of a complementary yet opposing relationship between gold and bitcoin. It notes: If you had invested in gold, you would have made 52%, and 64% from investing in bitcoin. However, if you had invested in both of them on a 50/50 basis, and rebalanced each month, you’d now have 93% (to end of August 2020 ByteTree data).  Elsewhere, the report adopts the view that Bitcoin is an inherently “internet economy”, where its success is directly linked to the level of activity and the size of the user base on the network. It explores the significance of network effects on the largest cryptocurrency. It also delves into the underlying technological framework of Bitcoin and proposes a number of possible ways for the asset to evolve further from a utility standpoint.

However, even though over 18 million coins have been minted to-date there’s a number of different elements that affect the distribution of all the coins in existence. Elements that affect bitcoin distribution include large holders, lost coins, so-called sleeping coins, and coins held in custody for various solutions. As of today, the outstanding circulating BTC supply is around 18,508,600 BTC, but during the last 12 months, many people have been discussing the actual distribution of the circulating supply. For example, in mid-September news.Bitcoin.com reported on an analyst who said only 14 million out of the 21 million supply cap will ever circulate. Last year, Coin Metrics also published an analysis, which discussed a variety of methods to assess Bitcoin’s true supply. At that time, as of block height 600,000, Coin Metric’s assessment of BTC’s “liquid” supply was around 16.3 million. Just recently, the web portal Blockchaincenter.net published a massive visualization of Bitcoin’s circulating supply and distribution. The visual is quite large, but it shows how the existing supply of BTC is distributed among various entities and individuals. For instance, the graphic shows there’s 2.6 million BTC on exchanges, which accounts for 12% of the 21 million supply cap. The visualization also estimates there are 1.5 million zombie coins or so-called sleeping bitcoins. Blockchaincenter’s graph shows over 328,000 coins are mined every year until the next halving as well. Grayscale Investments Bitcoin Trust holds 450,000 BTC in reserves and that represents over 2.5% of the outstanding supply of bitcoins today. The chart also shows Microstrategy (38,250 BTC), the 120,000 BTC locked into Ethereum, and Tim Draper’s 30,000 BTC stash of old Silk Road coins. The visualization also shows hacks (120k BTC Bitfinex 2016), the Plustoken scam coins (200k BTC), and the 166,000 BTC sitting in Mt Gox wallets today. Blockchaincenter’s graphic displays how the current circulating and non-circulating supply is distributed today with a unique visual perspective. Bitcoin is quite scarce and only 2.5 million are left to mine until 2140, which is the year the last block will be mined into existence. The network is also extremely difficult to mine with the network’s difficulty touching 19.22T and the hashrate around 140 exahash per second (EH/s). Moreover, BTC will see a reward halving again on or around May 7, 2024 making the digital currency even more limited by design.

Moreover, recent technical analysis shows the dollar’s trade-weighted index chart indicates the USD might be in for a gigantic slide in value in the near future. As members of the U.S. Federal Reserve plan to convene this week, both gold and bitcoin (BTC) markets have started to climb in value ahead of the meeting. Bitcoin prices rose over 4% during the afternoon’s trading sessions and gold jumped 0.76% as well. The price of one ounce of fine gold is $1,956.24 at the time of publication.  Meanwhile, after a brief upswing in value, the U.S. dollar has started to show signs of weakness again after losing massive amounts of value this year. One financial commentator believes the “world is frozen in response to the deluge of U.S. dollars.” According to an article written by the business analyst, Stephen Bartholomeusz, “the world has been drowning in U.S. dollars” via “liquidity swaps with 14 central banks.” “The combination of the access to dollars, the extent of the monetary policy stimulus in the U.S. and the Fed’s recent decision to hold U.S. rates at their current negligible levels – negative in real terms – has seen the U.S. dollar depreciate about 9.3 percent against the basket of its major trading partners’ currencies since March 19,” Bartholomeusz wrote. “That’s its weakest level for more than two years.” Bartholomeusz added: A weak dollar exports deflation elsewhere. It helps US exporters be more competitive (albeit while harming importers in an economy with a structural trade deficit) and therefore one that imports more than it exports) while damaging the exports and growth prospects of economies elsewhere. In addition to Bartholomeusz’s ominous outlook, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) could see a sharper fall in the near future according to a technical analysis report published on Monday. The DXY technical analysis explains that charts show a “bearish, M-shaped chart pattern containing two peaks and a trough.” If the dollar’s trade-weighted index dips another 5% the pattern will be confirmed the author notes. The pattern is traditionally dubbed the “bearish double-top” and they are typically followed by a strong decline in value. “The most notorious double-top for the dollar came in 2001-2002, in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, and was followed by a 33% fall in the currency through 2004,” the analysis details. “[The USD] then rallied for about 11 months before continuing its slide to record lows in 2008.” When the members of the Fed meet on Tuesday and Wednesday, a number of analysts and economists think the meeting will fuel bitcoin and precious metals like gold. The cofounder of Gold Bullion Int. (GBI) and DTAP Capital, Dan Tapiero, championed the two assets after U.S. commercial real estate markets have started to show signs of pending disaster. “An entire asset class redefined almost overnight by [Covid-19],” Tapiero tweeted. “Total value of all U.S. commercial real estate is $16 trillion. Now entering the largest bear market since the late 80s? 50% price drop wipes out $8 trillion. Major econ drag/knock-on effects [are] huge. Rates stay 0%, + Gold and BTC.” A recent report published by Pacific Investment Management Co. (Pimco) also explained that the U.S. dollar value drop is just starting and there is “room for the world’s reserve currency to weaken against emerging markets.” Many emerging markets worldwide have advanced the use of crypto assets and decentralized finance (defi) markets.

The report highlights that in eight years as Bitcoin’s supply rate decreases “retail size addresses [will] begin to eat up all the new supply alone.” Even the next halving in 2024 could see retail accounting for acquiring 50% of the bitcoins in circulation. Not too long ago, cryptocurrency proponents witnessed the Bitcoin (BTC) network’s third halving, which cut the block reward by 50% on May 11, 2020. Just before the third BTC halving, the active supply issuance or inflation rate was around 3.8%. Today that number is steadily dropping and at the time of publication, BTC’s inflation rate is 3.51%. On June 29, a research report published by ZUBR Research details that in eight years, retail demand will outshine the rate of issuance by a long shot. The study called “Retail Investors Steady in Physical Bitcoin Snatch-Up” explains how the BTC network has entered the “next reward era.” “With 90% of all Bitcoins already mined, the remaining supply is estimated to take nearly 120 years to come to market,” ZUBR wrote. “This figure – the remaining 10% taking another 120 years – shows just how scarce the cryptocurrency already is.”  In time one of the great burdens will be liquidity and “physical Bitcoins become harder to come by.” The researcher’s findings also indicate that Covid-19 gave crypto proponents a glimpse at some potential scenarios. ZUBR Research also discussed the question of whether Bitcoin is a better version of gold or not. The study says that investors will have to weigh this decision as “demand has moved in decline for gold further extending that gap available on the market” during the Covid-19 crisis. “No doubt, Bitcoin saw strong demand in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The demand was similarly witnessed for gold,” the report highlights. ZUBR researchers add: There is a very critical difference to gold, however. Bitcoin supply constraints will not be a result caused by black swan events (such as the global COVID-19 lockdown that shut-in mines), but the permanent perpetual nature of the store-of-value cryptocurrency that is designed to cut off new supply. The study notes that the researchers leveraged data from the analytics firm Chainalysis. ZUBR predicts that retail demand will continue to grow this year and by 2028 the demand will be far greater than issuance. Just like with gold markets, the demand for bitcoin while remaining scarce could send the price of BTC sky high. The next halving will sill a lot of retail and investor demand but the fifth halving will see uncontrollable buying pressure. “Extrapolating future demand at this pace points to a very dramatic shift in 2028 when Bitcoin’s supply rate further decreases and these retail size addresses begin to eat up all the new supply alone,” ZUBR estimates. “By the time the next reward era comes around in 2024, retail could potentially account for eating up over 50% of the physical supply,” the researchers added. The paper concludes by stressing: With retail [investors] gunning hard, these supply constraints might come sooner rather than later should growth in demand from smaller investors remain as steady as it has in the past half-decade.

One specific and lucrative method of investment is dollar-cost averaging. If an individual was to invest $10 a week into purchasing bitcoins since July 2010, the $5,130 USD (overall cost of investment) would have purchased 3,040 BTC, giving the individual over $29 million worth of gains in a decade. There is one method of investment that many crypto investors would call the smartest way to invest in anything. Essentially, the method called “dollar-cost averaging” is a strategy that investors use to invest funds into an asset across a periodic number of purchases, which essentially reduces exposure to overall price volatility. So a person invests $1 to $10 per day or per week into a cryptocurrency and they become sheltered by the overall cost average over time. Finding the earliest price of bitcoin (BTC) is not too hard to and we can highlight that it occurred a few weeks after Laszlo Hanyecz purchased two Papa John’s pizzas for 10,000 coins (BTC value would be $0.0025 cents per unit). Not too long after Hanyecz’s exchange, historical resources say that the exchange rate for BTC jumped 10X until mid-July when a single BTC was swapping for $0.08 to $0.10 per coin. Coincidently, the popular exchange Mt Gox was launched on July 17, 2010.  Now bitcoin investors who jumped in on putting funds into the crypto-economy on July 17, 2010, and stuck with it until Bitcoin’s first halving on November 28, 2012, the average cost per BTC would be $3.81 per coin. That’s a 122,400% increase from $0.08 per coin. If that individual invested $10 per week into bitcoins they would have invested $1,240 over the course of over 150,000 BTC blocks mined or three and a half years. The person would have gathered 3,024 BTC at an average purchase price of $0.41 per coin. The value they would possess using today’s 2020 exchange rate in June would be $29 million. If that person instead started to invest in bitcoin at the start of the first halving at the end of November 2012, they too would have done very well. The average price between the first halving in 2012 to the July 9, 2016 halving is $376.75 per BTC. If the individual invested on November 28, 2012, you would have experienced an increase of 5,336% in value. Now say they invested $10 a week since the first halving and stopped investing on the day of the second Bitcoin halving. The individual would own 15.68 BTC worth $151,264 for investing a measly $1,890 U.S. dollars. The average purchase price at $10 per week between this period would be $120 per coin.  Again we can take another individual and note that they invested between the July 2016 halving up until May 11, 2020, the Bitcoin (BTC) network’s third reward halving. The price increased 1,206% from those two points in time and the average price per BTC would be $6121. If the individual invested $10 a week into BTC (Date Range- 07/09/2016-05/11/2020) they would have only invested $2,010 into the crypto economy.  The person would only own 0.82908926 BTC, but would have profited by $5,987. The cost average profit for this individual would amount to 297.71% in value gained. The average purchase price would be $2,424. Now if an individual participated in dollar-cost averaging and started on July 17, 2010, investing all the way until the third halving, the average cost per BTC would be $2,167.17. It’s safe to say that dollar-cost averaging is a less risky and cost-effective way to invest in anything, but with bitcoin, it has proven lucrative. Of course, BTC’s average cost percentage will rise, if the price rises going forward. The higher the price, the higher the average over time and if it goes lower it will be the opposite effect. Someday spanning it over 50 years would be cool as it’s only been 11 and half years of collecting dollar-cost average metrics with bitcoin. What do you think about the dollar-cost average investment method?

Oil prices have dropped below zero for the first time in history, and economic powerhouses like the U.S. are starting to show cracks in the system. Despite the souring economy, a number of analysts and economists predict that bitcoin and the crypto economy will rise triumphantly and bring a new class of millionaires. The global economy is not looking so good and it could get worse due to the ongoing industry lockdowns and stay-at-home orders worldwide. Despite the overly exaggerated graphs and charts showing the predicted mortality rate, the surge toward healthcare in the United States never really materialized. Medical professionals have been speaking out against the lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, but government officials across the nation have been too slow. The industry shutdowns in the U.S. have threatened the American economy, as close to 27 million citizens are out of work. Some estimates say that the unemployment rate in the U.S. is between 20-45% to date. Unemployment and shut down businesses across the nation are devastating the U.S. supply chain, causing mass disruption for truckers. While Wall Street and private banks like Blackrock were given hundreds of billions from the Federal Reserve, America’s truckers were left out of the stimulus proposal. The U.S. supply chain’s grinding slowdown has caused the food industry and farmers in America to have significant shortages and dump massive waste. The lockdown and stay-at-home orders are threatening U.S. pork suppliers, packing plants are closing shop, the commercial fishing industry is in a freefall, beef and cattle farmers are seeing shortages, wheat shortages are expected, dairy farmers are dumping milk, the clean and bottled water industry is threatened, and many more stories are sweeping the nation describing the supply chain and farm industry under immense pressure. With the supply chain feeling the economic hardships, it clearly has made it worse on the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar. Prices on food and necessities are starting to rise and with the petro-dollar crushed, many Americans fear hyperinflation could take the country by storm. The U.S. beef suppliers are already dealing with inflation and a price-gouging war. Moreover, the food shortages are not just in the U.S., as a myriad of countries are experiencing supply chain closures and limited food supplies. The looming economic depression has invoked a lot of macroeconomists and market strategists to predict what kinds of assets will be a hedge against hyperinflation and rising prices on goods like food. Of course, barter and trade will likely rule the roost, but many believe that the safe-haven asset gold will be far more valuable than it is today as well. A few analysts think that the crypto economy, which is valued at $225 billion today, will be another form of safe-haven assets that will benefit those trying to escape the financial storm. More recently, since the Covid-19 outbreak, observers have said that this is the time for BTC to shine and there are headlines calling Bitcoin “the story of the next decade.” Global Macro Investor CEO Raoul Pal expects bitcoin to be $1 million within the next five years. Another recent report says that after the block reward halving, “a new class of bitcoin millionaires may emerge.” The CEO of the cannabis business Juicyfields, Alan Glanse thinks the BTC economy will see “substantial market growth,” around 2-3 months after the halving. The stimulus packages have invoked a number of economists to believe that BTC will be fueled by hyperinflation and macroeconomic hardships. The CEO of the firm Coinzoom, Todd Crossland believes the stimulus from the Federal Reserve will bolster a “bull case” for the cryptocurrency. “While I applaud and support the government in taking the most aggressive measures in providing stimulus for the economy, just the magnitude of the stimulus and printing of dollars, and the accompanying debt gives me a reason to pause. The stimulus will come with inflation and subsequently pressure on the value of the dollar. In my opinion, this paints another bull case for bitcoin and digital assets,” Crossland said on April 27. Glanse, Crossland, and Pal are not the only ones who see BTC experiencing a parabolic phase during the economic shift. The well known firm Rothko Research, a think tank that shares frequent analysis and updates on the current global macro themes, believes bitcoin could easily capture 3-5% of the global gold market ($9-10 trillion). During the last economic rout a decade ago, many people predicted that double-digit inflation would cause gold to skyrocket Rothko said, but that forecast never materialized. Despite the last financial fallout’s outcome, Rothko thinks “this time is different” especially with the “combination of both monetary and fiscal stimuli will be inflationary in the medium term.” Rothko Researchers state: We saw that gold has already been trending higher against all currencies, and we do expect the trend to start in the crypto market as well. In fact, we think that Bitcoin will eventually capture 3 to 5 percent of the gold market share in the medium to long term. With approximately 190K tons of gold available above ground, the total market cap of gold is USD 10.5 trillion (for a spot price of $1,730 per ounce). Hence, with the total number of mined bitcoins at 18.3 million, a 3 to 5 percent of the total gold market cap would price a unit of Bitcoin between $17,240 and $28,740. This bullish belief has been the case for years for those who have always believed in bitcoin’s attributes. In November of 2019, the bitcoin proponent Rhythm Trader (RT) wrote that society is witnessing the “greatest wealth transfer” of our lifetime. RT describes how Millennials don’t trust financial institutions and banks these days. He mentions a recent survey from Etoro that says Millennials trust “cryptocurrency as an asset—at least, more than they do the stock market run by traditional Wall Street.” “The survey, commissioned by the independent research firm Provoke Insights, asked 1,000 online investors in the U.S., ages 20 through 65, about stock exchanges, cryptocurrency exchanges, and 401(k)s. Forty-three percent of millennial respondents said they trusted cryptocurrency exchanges more than U.S. stock exchanges,” RT’s report disclosed. RT’s paper is very similar to Global Macro Investor Raoul Pal’s outlook. The study concludes by highlighting: When it comes down to this “Great Wealth Transfer” of Boomers to Millennials, we know one thing for sure, Bitcoin is positioned as a vehicle for the storage of newly acquired wealth. Millennials have demonstrated a strong trend of embracing the digital age with open arms while at the same time turning their backs towards the traditional financial system. No one is certain that bitcoin will definitely rise to $20K, $100K, or even $1 million, but a decent number of crypto proponents are very optimistic it will happen. So far, the crypto economy has performed extremely well and has outshined gold and nearly every stock and commodity under the sun, despite the downturn on March 12. Although, not every analyst has the hopium most BTC supporters have today, as the well known financial trader Peter Brandt has told his 344,000 Twitter followers that BTC could drop below $1K per unit. Brandt has also said that the BTC halving is “grossly overrated in another tweet to his followers. “[The] Bitcoin halving = Grossly overrated,” Brandt said. “The daily trading volume of BTC = the real supply of BTC [and] the daily reduction of mined BTCs (NEW supply) equals approximately 2/100th of 1% of real supply. Reduction of new supply [because] of the halving as % of real supply = chump change,” the analyst added. What do you think about crypto investors experiencing a great wealth transfer?

GMI’s CEO Raoul Pal authored the report and he strongly believes the digital asset bitcoin will go from a $200 billion asset class to a $10 trillion asset class, within the next few years. In fact, Pal’s macro report stresses that the “Baby Boomer” generation is screwed and he expects this generation to sell away their nest eggs. A 120-page Global Macro Investor report explains that the world economy is headed for disaster. The coronavirus outbreak has added a lot of fear into our everyday lives, but the economic after-effects are extremely concerning. GMI’s Raoul Pal says that during the next several years, society will experience three phases; panic, hope, and insolvency. Pal remarks that he believes the world is currently in a “panic” phase, where liquidity starts to dry up and there’s a lot of selling. The “hope” phase will be the first big correction, which will lead to the last and final phase called “insolvency.” This period will be a “brutal phase” says Pal and it will change everything, including all beliefs in the system itself.  Pal’s charts and statistics show the economy is dragging downwards with great force, as his findings show China’s falling Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) has been falling like a rock. Chinese retail sales continue to plummet, the country’s industrial production is sliding, car sales are bombing, Fixed Assets Investment is dropping significantly, and consumer confidence is imploding.  All of these negative factors are all relatively the same in economically powerful countries like the U.S., Japan, Australia, and various regions in Europe. Moreover, one large piece of evidence that something is horribly wrong is the “worst unemployment data imaginable and the market rallied.” Pal’s report also discusses the similarities between now and the Great Depression that took place years ago. On page 31, Pal explains that he believes the Baby Boomer generation is in for a rude awakening. “The damage this does to the U.S. pension system is incomprehensible. The Baby Boomers will sell every rally they can to protect their last, rapidly diminishing nest egg,” Pal’s report details. “The Baby Boomers are totally f**ked [and] I have been publicly warning and warning about this.” Pal added: All of this is going to destroy the velocity of money for a very long time. Pal’s research says that gold is performing well through all this and it “will continue to do so.” The report notes that a break past $1,800 an ounce, will be the initial trigger and “massively outperform equities.” Pal expects gold to rise by possibly 3-5x in the next few years.  When Pal gets to the subject of Bitcoin, he stresses that the digital asset’s performance will be a “different story.” “I think [bitcoin] can get to $1 million in the same period. I think it can go from a $200 billion asset class to a $10 trillion asset class. Gold as a comparison is around $15 trillion now, including paper gold,” Pal said. “If gold goes up 5x, it becomes a $60 trillion asset, so would it be crazy for bitcoin to have a $10 trillion valuation?” Pal stated further: [Bitcoin] isn’t just a currency or even a store of value. It is an entire trusted, verified, secure, financial, and accounting system of value that can never be created outside of the cryptographic algorithm. It is nothing short of the future of our entire medium of exchange system, and of money itself and the platform on which it operates.  With all the other crypto projects and blockchains being created, Pal says the entire crypto economy could easily be a $100 trillion market valuation. “Bitcoin is a call option on it all — It is the future,” Pal concluded. He also added that he wholeheartedly believes that bitcoin is the “biggest trade of our lifetimes and just at the time when we need it most.” The report from GMI and its chief executive Raoul Pal follow the recent research by Bloomberg that says: “Bitcoin will be digital gold in 2020″.  Additionally, Bank of America (BoA) just published a report that indicates gold may jump 50% from its current price and possibly touch a high of $3K per ounce in the near future. “Beyond traditional gold supply and demand fundamentals, financial repression is back on an extraordinary scale,” the BoA report’s author said.

The metric is the largest number since June 2017 and the study notes that “HODL waves” have grown larger.  Also Read: Get Ready for the Bitcoin Halving – Here Are 9 Countdown Clocks You Can Monitor On March 3, Coin Metrics published its “State of the Network” update which covers the BTC network by leveraging various perspectives and data sets. Within the report written by Jacob Franek, the researcher discusses unspent transaction output (UTXO) age analysis and HODL waves. News.Bitcoin.com first reported on the subject of HODL waves in April 2018, after Dhruv Bansal, the cofounder of Unchained Capital, published an in-depth report on the subject. Essentially, Bansal and his team described how they analyzed the BTC network’s UTXOs over the course of a few years and figured out how to measure distinct holding periods. A bitcoin UTXO represents the unspent funds stemming from bitcoin transactions and this data is recorded on the blockchain. When Coin Metrics analyst Franek discussed the subject in the latest update, he noted the earliest contribution to this field was when the term “Bitcoin days destroyed” was first defined. Franek noted other contributions to the study of HODL waves in 2014 and the writer mentioned Bansal’s 2018 research as well. Unchained Capital’s post on the subject was “instrumental in introducing active supply to a broader audience,” Franek wrote. Two more studies were mentioned (Blummer 2018 and Hauge 2019) in Coin Metrics’ report, both of which research the behavior of bitcoin holders from different angles. When mentioning Franek’s study, fellow Coin Metrics researcher Nate Maddrey explained that 42% of all BTC hasn’t moved in two years. “As of March 1st, about 42% of all BTC has not been moved on-chain (i.e. transacted) for at least two years,” Maddrey tweeted. The analyst added: The amount of BTC untouched in more than two years has not eclipsed 42% since July, 2017. Unchained Capital has a live chart that shows all the bitcoins in existence and waves are defined by Bitcoin Age Days (BADs). Essentially, the colored coded chart calculates waves of age distribution within BTC’s identified UTXOs and their age distribution set back to the genesis block in 2009. “The colored bands show the relative fraction of Bitcoin in existence that was last transacted within the time window indicated in the legend,” the Unchained Capital HODL waves chart notes. “The bottom, warmer colors (reds, oranges) represent Bitcoin transacting very recently while the top, cooler colors (greens, blues) represent Bitcoin that hasn’t transacted in a long time.” BTC holders are not the only crypto proponents storing their coins for long periods of time. A recent post on the Reddit forum r/btc called “Iron Hands” compares three different cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, and BCH) using Coinmarketcap.com’s new chain analysis feature. According to the screenshot and Coinmarketcap.com statistics, the holders’ composition by time held shows that BCH is around 92%, while BTC is 63% and ETH is 54%. “Interesting that a higher percentage of BCH users are using [bitcoin cash] as a store of value than BTC users,” Bitcoin.com’s executive chairman Roger Ver wrote in response to the thread. “BCH isn’t just a store of value, it’s a great medium of exchange. And like any currency, financially responsible folks will spend some and save some,” explained another BCH proponent on Reddit. Data from charts.Bitcoin.com shows the UTXO Set Size for the BCH network is 68 million, while statistics from the BTC network’s UTXO Set Size are around the same. The great hodling of BTC and BCH has been taking place just before both networks experience the block subsidy halvings. The BTC chain has 9,819 blocks left to go (at the time of writing) and 68 days left until the halving on or around May 11, 2020. The BCH chain has 5,001 blocks left to go and 34 days left until the halving on or around April 8, 2020. What do you think about the recent study by Coin Metrics analyst Jacob Franek and the HODL waves research? What do you think about bitcoin cash holders composition by time held showing that BCH is being held for longer periods? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

The last time the central bank slashed rates by leveraging an “emergency rate shift” by half a percentage point was after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in 2008. The announcement didn’t have a favorable effect on the stock market and the Dow shed close to 800 points after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced the cut. Also Read: This Is How Much BTC You Need to Enter Bitcoin’s Elite 1% Club It’s safe to say that global markets have been shaken by the coronavirus crisis and governments and central banks worldwide are reacting. Last week U.S. stock markets were extremely bloody and assets like precious metals and cryptocurrencies took a hit too. On Monday the Dow Industrial Jones saw a 1,200-point advance as it seemed like a recovery was on the cards. However, on Tuesday as coronavirus fears continued to extend across the globe, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 bps and explained it was due to the coronavirus crisis and the overall “outlook” of the economy. Almost immediately after the Fed’s announcement, all three major stock indices dropped significantly percentage-wise and the Dow lost close to 800 points. “We saw the risk to the outlook to the economy and chose to act,” Powell told reporters on Tuesday. “I don’t think anybody knows how long it will be,” he added. “I know the US economy is strong and we’ll get to the other side of this and return to solid growth and a solid labor market as well.” Since September 2019, the Fed has been feeding private banks with billions in overnight repos and it has cut rates three times already but not nearly as much as Tuesday. In fact, the last time the Fed cut rates by half a percentage point was during the 2008 economic crisis. One month before the “emergency rate shift” on September 15, 2008, the U.S. saw the largest bankruptcy in the country’s history. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and the Fed decided to take action. Roughly three weeks later on October 8, 2008, the Fed used an emergency rate shift and cut rates by 50 basis points (bps) to 1.5%. “The Committee took this action in light of evidence pointing to a weakening of economic activity and a reduction in inflationary pressures,” the Federal Open Market Committee explained at the time.  Of course, the Fed did more than just that as they opened the floodgates of quantitative easing and stimulated private banks while the taxpayers had to foot the bill. 2008 saw massive bank bailouts and the Fed ultimately slashed the interest rate as low as 0.25%. Prior to the Lehman Brothers collapse, the Fed cut rates on January 22, 2008 by 75 bps and 50 bps in August 2007. It was six years before the 2008 financial crisis when the central bank slashed interest rates by 50 bps because of the 9/11 attacks. On September 17, 2001, a few days after the World Trade Center bombings, the Fed told the public the central bank would offer “unusually large volumes of liquidity.” The Fed’s interest rate cut of 50 bps on Tuesday didn’t have much of a favorable outcome on the New York Stock Exchange and Moody’s Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi said it “undermined confidence.” “Cutting rates was the right policy choice, certainly the right thing to do, but doing it the way they did was a mistake,” Zandi explained during an interview on Tuesday. “Certainly we know that in hindsight,” Zandi added. “It didn’t do what it was supposed to do and that was instill confidence. It, in fact, undermined confidence.” Following the Federal Reserve’s surprise interest rate cut on March 3, the price of the precious metal gold surged by $49 on Tuesday to $1,638 an ounce. Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff commented on the Fed’s move and said: “Lower interest rates will do nothing to alter coronavirus related consumer behavior.” “The Fed’s real concern was the reverse wealth effect lower stock prices would have on consumers and the economy. So the rate cut was not really about the coronavirus, but the stock market,” Schiff added. Schiff also got some press for predicting the current economic downturn and the 2008 financial crisis as well. While gold investors were pleased with the price of gold spiking after the Fed’s announcement, cryptocurrency markets remained lackluster. Crypto markets did erase some gains on Tuesday but not nearly as close as the lift gold saw. While there are some people who believe a financial crisis would be good for BTC prices and the Fed’s surprise cut was a cherry on top, other speculators believe the opposite. A survey from the Twitter account Crypto Kanoon says: “There is a common narrative floating in the industry that coronavirus will take the stock market down hence it will lead to [a] bitcoin pump. Is there a correlation between [the] stock market and crypto?” There are four answers that could be picked which include: “stocks up and BTC down, stocks down and BTC up, it is random, and no correlation.” With over 630 votes and more than 37.4%, the “no correlation” choice led the vote, but “stocks down and BTC up” followed slightly behind.  Blockchain angel investor Qiao Wang also discussed BTC’s performance during a possible global recession. “Sorry to put a pin in the bubble, but Bitcoin traded like an absolute sh**coin over [the] last couple of weeks,” Wang tweeted. “If you are a crypto business or hold a large amount of crypto, you should probably start thinking about hedging against a mild global recession.” Wang added: Every short-term time frame I look at, be it 1 minute, hourly, or daily, Bitcoin looks depressingly correlated with [S&P 500]. I’m not saying Bitcoin will necessarily get crushed by a mild recession, but you probably want to update your Bayesian probabilities. Former Bitcoin Foundation director Bruce Fenton tweeted the situation as well. “I’d take some crypto off the table until this shakes out — Even Bitcoin will likely be hit by this — Long term fundamentals should be solid still,” Fenton stressed. “The use case of limited supply money could be even more appealing. But a speculative and volatile asset will have a hard time,” he added. Still, there are many people that believe BTC will perform as well as gold has in the last few days or fulfill everyone’s uncorrelated asset theories. “[S&P 500] and Google Trends for ‘coronavirus’ are almost mirror images of each other – SPX is nearly completely tied to coronavirus fear — r = -0.9,” tweeted Cane Island Alternative Advisors’ Timothy Peterson. “Bitcoin is [the] least correlated (-> BTC doesn’t care). Gold has been the best hedge: +0.6 correlation.” What do you think about the Fed’s interest rate cut and the effect on the stock exchange on Tuesday? What do you think about cryptocurrencies and how they will perform if the world is hit by a financial crisis? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

For instance, according to Blockworks Group analyst Jake Levison, if you own 0.28 BTC “you’re statistically guaranteed to be in the richest 1% of the world in BTC terms.” Regardless of the amount of BTC required to qualify as a one-percenter, it’s a debate that has raged on for years. Also read: 13 Crypto Debit Cards You Can Use Right Now On February 18, Blockworks Group analyst Jake Levison tweeted about what it takes to make it into the top 1% of bitcoin holders worldwide. “If you own 0.28 BTC, you’re statistically guaranteed to be in the richest 1% of the world in BTC terms,” explained Levison. Despite the fact that the tweet received 1.5K likes, not everyone agreed with Levison’s estimate. “Maybe earlier, in 2030, average holdings are only 0.01 BTC, assuming 1 billion using the network,” Twitter user @Haggsboson replied. The 2030 assumption came from the recent study written by Unchained Capital’s Parker Lewis called “Bitcoin Obsoletes All Other Money.” Levison’s opinion is not really new either as others have assumed that 0.28 BTC gets you into the richest 1% of bitcoin owners.  Former Google Product Director Steve Lee said the same thing in October 2018. “If you own 0.28 BTC and HODL, you can be certain no more than 1% of the current world’s population can ever own more BTC than you. A modest investment of $1,830 today can ensure you are a 1%er in a future Bitcoin world,” Lee tweeted. Not too many people disagreed with Lee’s statement in 2018 but one replied: “That’s true but you have to factor in that not all wealth will be in BTC. You might be in the 1% top BTC balances but not in the top 1% wealth.” So the average bitcoiner in the eyes of some holds around 0.01 BTC and a few people agree that 0.28 BTC gets you into the Bitcoin 1% club. But even these two estimates from Lee and Levison might be too low, as research suggests that 15 BTC is the minimum needed to join BTC’s 1%. A chart published in 2017 estimates that the top 1% of bitcoin holders need at least 15 BTC and 89 BTC to make the top 0.1%. According to the Blocklink.info chart, there are 225,000 people within the top 1% percentile. A similar study was published by Bambouclub on September 9, 2017, and both reports leverage a new model of BTC distribution. Bambouclub and the Blocklink.info studies model BTC’s distribution using a scheme that “disregards wallet and address data entirely.” The model’s assumptions include: In order to make the 0.01%, Blocklink.info’s chart shows you need 433 BTC and to make the highest order of bitcoin holders (0.001%), you would need 7,021 BTC. The study assumes only 500 people are in the 0.01% and just 250 people are in the 0.001% in 2017. However, it’s hard to get more accurate estimates in regard to the wealthiest bitcoiners because no one truly knows the number of people worldwide who own even a small fraction of BTC. Moreover, there’s a great number of lost bitcoins and in January 2020 it was estimated that more than 10 million BTC have been sitting dormant for a whole year. The 10.7 million BTC lost is part of the largest number of coins that haven’t moved since the spring months of 2017. The number of BTC needed to get into the top 1% is roughly between 0.28 BTC to 15 BTC depending on the person you ask or the study referenced to get that calculation. Steve Lee’s 2018 estimate assumes that there will only be 21 million bitcoins and this is divided by 0.28 and then again divided by the number of people living on earth, which is 7.7 billion people as of April 2019. Jake Levison backed up his statement when someone asked him when 0.28 BTC will get you into BTC’s 1% club. “From now until the end of time,” Levison tweeted. The Blockworks Group analyst added: My tweet was saying that if you own 0.28 BTC, only 1% of the world will ever be able to own more than you. Hence putting you in the top 1%. The answer to the BTC 1% club question is quite debatable and there are a few different calculations. The reason for this is the number of unknowns that cannot be calculated in a precise fashion such as the exact number of BTC holders, the approximate number of lost and stolen coins, and the number of wallets worldwide. Moreover, there’s a lot of skewed data online that attempts to estimate the number of bitcoin owners in different countries and worldwide. For instance, according to a survey and research report written by Spencer Bogart of the venture capital firm Blockchain Capital, “9% of the [American] population owns bitcoin.” “Including 18% of those aged 18–34 and 12% of those aged 35–44,” Bogart wrote on April 30, 2019. However, a big discrepancy with Bogart’s estimate is the fact that the study only surveyed 2,052 American adults rather than the 209 million adults who are currently 18 years of age and over. We can try to come close to answering the speculative 1% question, but just like measuring the world’s richest gold holders, we can only guess the number of BTC held by individuals worldwide. What do you think about the estimates for making it into the BTC 1% club? Do you think it’s 0.28 BTC or more than that like the 15 BTC estimate from Blocklink.info’s report?

Today, 77 days before the reward halving, BTC’s inflation rate is around 3.6% and it’s expected to drop to 1.8% after the halving event. The cryptocurrency’s inflation rate will be lower than the average inflation target central banks reference worldwide at 2%. Unlike central banks, no one person or centralized entity can make adjustments to BTC’s monetary inflation rate. Also Read: Get Ready for the Bitcoin Halving – Here Are 9 Countdown Clocks You Can Monitor Back in 2009, after the Bitcoin network launched, Satoshi explained in various emails that bitcoins were meant to be scarce. On July 9, 2010, Satoshi wrote: “When someone tries to buy all the world’s supply of a scarce asset, the more they buy the higher the price goes.” Bitcoin’s inventor also created a limited number of bitcoins that will ever be produced and a systematical and mathematical reward reduction every 210,000 blocks. Crypto enthusiasts call the block subsidy reduction a “halving,” as the block rewards are always cut in half. Today the active supply of BTC is around 3.6-3.8% and this is because analysts assume there is far less than the 18.2 million circulating supply of BTC. We know this is true because a great number of users have lost coins, and older wallets created years ago haven’t spent their BTC in over five years. Moreover, studies conclude that close to 11 million BTC has not moved in over a year. BTC’s active supply coupled with demand and the reward rate decreasing every four years developed a predictable economic system with an inflationary rate no one can control. In 2011, BTC’s inflation rate was between 30-50% and between 2011 and 2014 it dropped to 12%. After the halving in 2016, when the block reward was cut from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC, the inflation rate kicked down to 5-4%. Today, throughout the month of February 2020, the BTC network’s inflation rate is between 3.59% and 3.86%. Interestingly, the inflation rate for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is roughly the same at 3.71% on Feb. 24. This means that in 77 days BTC’s inflation will drop (BCH is 44 days) lower (1.8%) than the average central banks’ target inflation rate. Most central banks like the Federal Reserve keep the inflation rate target around 2%, but there are a few lenient countries that reference rates as high as 4%. Central banks worldwide are known for manipulating inflation rates with the tendency to increase reference rates and print massive quantities of fiat reserves. Satoshi’s systematically and mathematically designed monetary inflation rate, however, cannot be changed unless the original rules of the system are broken. So far, during the last 11 years, the rules have not been broken and consensus remains strong around the 21 million capped supply. People believe that as BTC’s price gains more value, the purchasing power increases over time making it deflationary in that sense. Since BTC gained real-world value nine years ago, it has increased significantly over the last decade but we don’t know how long the trend will last. If BTC’s price continues to increase, the economics of the inflation rate coupled with ceteris paribus (outside conditions remain the same), it would provide a new system, unlike the world’s current monetary status. Those who participate in the economic crypto experiment may experience some different conditions than the ceteris paribus going forward. A number of crypto speculators believe it will be a positive outcome and the biggest wealth transfer the world has seen in decades. A slew of well known bitcoiners and crypto influencers truly believe this will happen. “Within the next few decades, Millennials will become the wealthiest generation in history and banks should be worried, if they’re not already,” insists the BTC commentator and author Rhythm Trader. His November 2019 blog post added: Millennials have started making a major shift towards the use of unconventional banking, with Bitcoin posed to be the beneficiary of the ‘Great Wealth Transfer’ of our time. People who believe in central planning and the current monetary system wholeheartedly disagree with Rhythm Trader’s optimism. For instance, in April 2013, the popular American author Matthew O’Brien wrote that BTC has a “massive deflationary bias” as some economists have always believed bitcoins will fall into a deflationary spiral. “Its money supply is mostly fixed, but the menu of things it can buy is growing. The same amount of money chasing more goods means money will be worth more. Or, put another way, prices will fall in Bitcoin terms. And that’s why it’s not a currency, and won’t be one until it has a central bank.” Although central banks claim 2% is the reference mark globally, shadowstats.com notes that the real rate could be as high as 10%. Crypto proponents don’t know what will happen with the economics and market values after the halvings occur on the three SHA256 networks this spring. The best references that can be used are the rules of the network and the fact that unlike central banks, nobody decides what the inflation target for the upcoming years will be. Instead, the inflation rate and issuance of BTC is fairly predictable and can be easily charted. This spring, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market valuation will have an inflation rate less than the central planners’ inflation rate and four years after that event, it will be considerably less. In fact, estimates show that BTC’s inflation rate will meander around 1.8% until the next halving and will likely be 1.1%. Estimates also show that through the year 2025 and the halving in 2026 BTC’s inflation rate will be as low as 0.4%. What do you think about the BTC inflation rate after the halvings? What do you think about the inflation rate dropping below the central banks’ average of 2%? Let us know what you think about this topic in the comments section below.

Google searches for “bitcoin” have increased since December to about half of those registered in June last year. There’s one country that sticks out as a benchmark for the indicator. Nigeria has consistently topped the chart in the past 12 months. Only a couple of other African nations, Ghana and South Africa, come close.  Also read: Wifi Sharing Platform Wicrypt Gets Government Grant in Nigeria Although it’s the continent’s largest economy, Nigeria is facing numerous economic and social challenges. Last year it overtook India as the country with the largest population living in extreme poverty, almost 87 million of its 200 million people. In the past two years, the Nigerian economy has returned to growth but since last summer inflation has been rising too, with the annual inflation rate almost touching 12% in December 2019.  Scams taking advantage of the desperate and warnings issued by the central bank against Bitcoin have not deterred Nigerians from trying to learn more about cryptocurrencies, buying coins and using them in everyday life. For example, after a decrease last fall, trading volumes on the peer-to-peer exchange Localbitcoins are picking up again, reaching over 600 million Nigerian naira a week, or $1.65 million, according to data compiled by Coin Dance. Being a country with so many people struggling to meet ends, Nigeria is quite reliant on remittances from migrants who live and work abroad. Between January and November 2019 it received $17.57 billion from the diaspora, the Central Bank of Nigeria announced in January. The total represents an increase of 56.4% over the same period in 2018. Like other African nations, however, Nigeria pays very high fees for cross-border transfers that can reach almost 10%, as news.Bitcoin.com reported. Cryptocurrencies provide an economical alternative to the fiat system, but in order to be a viable option a functioning trading and exchange infrastructure is needed. Luckily, Nigeria has a number of local platforms that support purchases and sales of digital coins with the national currency, the naira. Options include Nairaex, which is the largest local crypto exchange supporting several payment methods to buy and sell BTC including bank transfers, and bitcoin remittance platform Bitpesa. The latter works with M-Pesa, a popular mobile phone-based money transfer service initially launched in Kenya and Tanzania. Nigerians can use Bitpesa to buy bitcoin with debit cards. They can also take advantage of the services offered by Wallet.ng, Busha, Tradefada, Bitfxt, and many more.  Nigerians now also have plenty of options to use cryptocurrencies. Paychant is a payment processor that offers a cryptocurrency gateway for businesses to accept digital coins through instant conversion to local fiat, NGN in this case, helping them to protect their revenues from crypto price volatility. The platform currently supports BTC and ETH. Merchants who want to accept crypto directly can download and install the Bitcoin Cash Register app. The point of sale software will allow them to process BCH payments. A growing number of Nigerian companies already accept payments in cryptocurrency, the Buy Bitcoin Worldwide website reveals. One of them is the mobile airtime and SMS packages provider Gsm2me. The Nigerian platforms works with over 500 networks in 135 countries. Lagos-based online boutique shop and leather atelier Minku is another example.

A few speculators believe bitcoin miners and whales are hoarding coins right now until after the adjustment so prices will be driven up. Moreover, for the first time, crypto proponents will observe how both BTC and BCH deal with the reward reduction as both networks are mined by some of the same pools. Also read: Generation QE: How Central Banks Create Money From Thin Air When Satoshi released the Bitcoin protocol, one of the rules that came with the program was the fact that the block reward gets cut in half every four years (every 210,000 blocks) depending on hashrate speed. The last time digital currency fans saw a reward halving was on July 9, 2016, at block 419,975 when the BTC block reward was cut in half from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC. At the time there were 15.7 million BTC mined into existence and roughly 1.4 exahash per second (EH/s) processed blocks on the chain. A little over a year later, the heightened scaling debate led to a hard fork on August 1, 2017, when the chain split into two factions. More than two years have passed and a slew of mining pools processing the consensus hashing algorithm SHA256 now mine on both networks. At press time, there is 18,041,637 BTC mined into circulation and the next halving should occur in 184 days. Currently, the hashrate processing the BTC chain is around 94.48 EH/s and at this speed, the halving will occur on May 14, 2020. There are 26,668 blocks left to mine on the BTC chain before the subsidy reduction and miners will have obtained 333,350 BTC processing blocks up until this point. Miners processing the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network are using between 2.75-4 EH/s over the course of the last week. There’s been 18,107,613 BCH mined into existence so far and 608,598 blocks recorded to-date. Data shows that the BCH chain will experience a reward halving a month earlier than BTC on April 8, 2020. At the time when the reward halves, the BCH block reward will drop from 12.5 BCH to 6.25 BCH. Ten days ago, Bitcoin.com published a video with professional miners from around the world who explained what they think will happen during the halving. The film included Hyperblock’s CEO Sean Walsh, Genesis Mining CEO Marco Streng, F2Pool’s Global Director Thomas Heller, and quite a few mining heavyweights. The mining industry executives mentioned topics like BTC’s inflation rate dropping lower than USD and EUR for the first time ever after the reward halving. They also discussed how the last halving was ‘priced in’ and whether or not that same trend will happen again. “The halving is a brutal wipe-out event,” Marco Streng stressed in the film. “It knocks out immediately the miners who are not efficient enough and shows no mercy.” Statistics show that BTC’s inflation rate is at 3.85% at the time of writing, while the inflation rate for BCH is similar at 3.74%. There are a few metrics that also show miners and whales are likely hoarding coins before the next reward reduction. Mining data stemming from both BTC and BCH chains show that there’s been a lot more divergence between freshly generated coins and the first time they are spent onchain. Speculators believe miners will hoard coins to drive up the price so they can maintain the same revenues after the halving. The onchain market intelligence company Glassnode has shown that BTC whales are accumulating lots of coins. On October 11, Glassnode tweeted that the number of whales (BTC addresses with 1,000 BTC or more) had reached an all-time high. All of these factors are taken into consideration when discussing the theoretical events tied to the next halvings. The truth is no one knows exactly what will happen during the BCH and BTC reward reductions. Right now miners from both networks are chugging along processing blocks so transactions can be confirmed. There are six different pools that mine both chains including Viabtc, Antpool, Btc.com, Btc.top, Bitcoin.com, and Poolin. When both halvings occur, a lot of other metrics will affect the networks including the current price during the subsidy reduction, the difficulty on both chains, and energy costs. Some people believe that after the next halving home or hobby mining might become nonexistent and only situated pools with significant hashpower will survive.

Some of its features, however, like the characteristic irreversibility of blockchain transactions, have created certain challenges for the traditional legal and financial systems. At times they may seem incompatible with cryptocurrencies, but that’s not always the case.  Also read: Telegram Offers to Postpone Launch of the TON Network Matthias Lehmann, director of the Institute for International Private and Comparative Law at the University of Bonn, explores some of the challenges decentralized digital currencies pose to the current legal systems and proposes solutions in a recently published article. But Instead of focusing on transfers resulting from fraud, like the media often does, the German professor turns attention to “less reported” but equally possible transactions. Lehmann highlights two groups of problems – ‘endogenous,’ associated with faulty transfers where the sender commits a mistake or lacks legal capacity to make the transfer, and ‘exogenous’ problems, when a need for correction may arise because of events taking place outside of the blockchain. The latter category includes insolvency proceedings, for example, or succession of crypto assets. The distributed ledger technology (DLT) was designed to prohibit double spending, but it cannot reverse faulty transfers and does not allow for a transfer of title outside the blockchain, the scholar notes.  These are common problems and they are pretty standard in private law, the legal expert remarks. But imposing the ordinary rules of private law is not an option in the case of cryptocurrencies. That’s because of the irreversibility of blockchain transactions, on the one hand, and the difficulties in establishing the governing law, on the other. Instead of advocating the easy way out by rejecting what doesn’t fit into existing presumptions, Professor Lehmann suggests a workaround. To fulfil its corrective function under such circumstances, private law may resort to implementing the concept of ‘obligation to make a transfer.’ The author further elaborates: “For instance, a person who has received a certain amount of Bitcoin by error could be obliged to send back the same amount. A transfer obligation may also be the remedy of choice to effectuate the rights of an insolvency administrator or the heir of an estate.” Other existing laws can be applied to permissionless networks too, like the law of torts in the case of a coerced transfer and the law of restitution to return crypto assets sent by mistake. Matthias Lehmann thinks the validity of a blockchain transfer should not be assessed using the ordinary concepts of property law and insists that when a correction is needed, transfer obligations will do the job. Thus an “overly assertive role of the law that would make the DLT inefficient and ultimately unviable” can be avoided. The proposed solution corrects the results of a transaction “only to the extent necessary, using the forms and procedures of the DLT” and “dispenses with the need for identifying one national law governing the blockchain by distributing the applicable rules among the various affected legal systems.” Decentralized digital currencies are also criticized by the establishment for their volatility which, according to the apologists of the fiat system, makes them inappropriate for a number of applications that require a stable unit of account. The rapid and sometimes significant change in market prices makes it hard to accurately gauge the value of items priced in cryptocurrency, they claim for instance, despite the existence of products and services that already bridge the gap between young, free crypto markets and traditional markets dominated by centrally managed fiat systems.  One of the characteristics of the crypto space that distinguishes it from the traditional financial world is that bitcoin doesn’t have a fixed exchange rate against other currencies such as those determined by central banks for fiat currencies. However, a reference figure like that is sometimes needed, for example, in court cases involving financial relations or when estimating someone’s tax obligations for holdings in a currency different from the national fiat. The Russian Association of Cryptoindustry and Blockchain and the Russian Bar Association have recently proposed a solution. The two organizations came up with a formula to set an ‘official,’ so to speak, exchange rate for a particular cryptocurrency. Price data acquired from several digital asset exchanges every 30 seconds will be used to calculate a daily weighted average and the result will be published once every 24 hours. Taking that value as a benchmark, reference exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and the Russian ruble can also be determined and used in accounting.

As strange as it may sound today, there have been times when banking crises were rare, pay was rising alongside productivity, and the U.S. dollar would buy a certain amount of pure gold. Despite its obvious successes in certain areas, the global monetary system that laid the foundations for this time of stable growth eventually failed, and here’s why.  Also read: Crypto Salaries Gain Regulatory Recognition Around the World The post-World War II era started with a negotiated monetary system that set the rules for international commercial and financial relations. This was a product of the Bretton Woods agreement from 1944, which created a new financial order in a world devastated by its largest military conflict yet. The conference in New Hampshire, held before the war was over, established the main pillars of global finance and trade: the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), now part of the World Bank Group. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), later replaced by the World Trade Organization (WTO), was signed soon after. The governments behind the Bretton Woods system, many of them wartime allies against Nazi Germany, aimed to create a world in which a major armed conflict and a global depression could never happen again. That was to be achieved by building an effective international monetary system and reducing barriers to free trade. Over 700 representatives of 44 countries hammered the agreement in the course of a month. No bankers were invited to take part, by the way. The delegates decided that their monetary construct should rest on the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. In an effort to replicate the pre-war gold standard, although in a limited form, the dollar was tied to the precious metal at a fixed price. The United States government committed to convert dollars into gold at $35 an ounce. The U.S. currency became the new gold standard, while retaining flexibility in comparison with real gold. A system of fixed exchange rates was then introduced, in which all other major currencies were pegged to the gold-backed U.S. dollar. Participating nations had to maintain currency prices within 1% of parity through interventions in their foreign exchange markets. Purchases and sales of foreign currency were constantly made to keep rates close to the target. The Bretton Woods system was effectively a monetary union with the dollar being its main currency. For some time it generated the stability the post-war world needed to recover and rebuild. Virtually no major country experienced a banking crisis during the period the agreement was respected, between 1945 and 1971. Speculative financial flows were seriously curtailed and investment capital was channeled into industrial and technological development instead. Helping national economies grow, creating jobs and lowering trade barriers were to give peace a better chance. And to a large extent they did, aside from cold war proxy conflicts.  Several notable achievements resulted from the Bretton Woods arrangement in a variety of domains. An online portal called WTF Happened In 1971?, the year when President Nixon’s administration unilaterally terminated the U.S. dollar’s convertibility to gold, summarizes most of them, backed with astonishing numbers. For example, up until Washington’s decision to end the dollar-gold standard, productivity rose steeply and wages, unlike nowadays, didn’t fall behind. In other words, the rising value of goods and services translated into rising pay for workers. The 119% increase in productivity from 1947 to 1979, the last year when these indicators were moving together, was closely followed by a 100% positive change in the average hourly compensation. Since then, until 2009, productivity has grown by a whopping 80%, while compensation scored only an 8% increase, the quoted data shows.  Similar trends can be observed with many other pairs of indicators. Divergence between real GDP per capita and average real wage in the U.S. has been growing steadily since the 70s, according to the calculations of the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The consumer price index skyrocketed after the untying of the dollar from gold. The same applies to the median sales price of new homes sold in the country. And against this backdrop, divorce prevalence and incarceration rates in the U.S. increased markedly. The post-war semi-gold standard mitigated income inequality in the United States, which had been rising in the years following the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 and jumped again after the U.S. government decided to turn the dollar into purely fiat money. Since 1971, the top 1% of earners have seen their income grow significantly, while that of the bottom 90% has remained almost unchanged for decades. The curves crossed somewhere in the beginning of the century and in the years after the 2008 global financial crisis the rich have been getting richer, while the poor have been getting poorer again. Other negative trends after the abolition of the last gold standard include the ballooning U.S. national debt, from well below a trillion dollars in the 70s to over $20 trillion in 2018. As of June 2019, federal debt held by the public amounted to $16.17 trillion. Last year it was approximately 76% of GDP and the Congressional Budget Office expects it to reach over 150% by 2040. At the same time, the United States’ goods trade balance has dropped dramatically, reaching a record low of almost -$80 billion at the end of December.  Bretton Woods, despite its positives, had some significant flaws that eventually led to its demise. Unlike the gold it was backed by, the dollar, which was the system’s reserve currency, could be manipulated by the powers in Washington in accordance with America’s own interests, and it was. Dollars were supposed to provide liquidity to the world economy but initially the United States wasn’t printing enough of them. As a result, its partners experienced shortages of convertible currency. And in the later years the opposite occurred, the greenback was too inflated by the U.S. It quickly became evident that the agreement is tailored to the interests of the United States, which at the time of its signing owned two thirds of the global gold reserves.  In essence, the monetary union gave too much power to the U.S. and was only going to work as long as other countries were willing to accept the status quo. With Washington exporting inflation to the rest of the world, however, its partners started to convert large amounts of dollars into gold while the U.S. was ratcheting up the political pressure on them to accept and keep its printed money at fixed rates against their national currencies. Eventually, countries like France decided that enough is enough and started selling their dollars for gold. The U.S. then broke the link between its currency and the precious metal, which, along with the return of floating exchange rates, effectively put an end to Bretton Woods and the gold standard. A similar situation currently exists in Europe’s own monetary union. Critics say much of its problems stem from its very design, which heavily favors the interests of Germany, the continent’s economic locomotive and one of the world’s largest exporters. The government in Berlin is a supporter of low inflation which ensures German high tech industrial exports continue to bring high revenues. However, in the Eurozone’s southern flank countries such as Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Greece need higher inflation to remain competitive as exporters. It is becoming evident that a reserve currency beyond the control of various governments would be an improvement over fiat money subordinate to the national interests of one superpower or another. A cryptocurrency that serves as a means of exchange, store of value, unit of account, and which cannot be inflated or deflated through biased political decisions could be an instrument that would facilitate global commercial and financial transactions without favoring a side. Besides, participating parties would own the real asset itself and not some derivative.  Satoshi Nakamoto must have thought about these matters when designing Bitcoin. The person, or persons, behind this name listed a symbolic date as their birthday on Satoshi’s P2P Foundation profile – April 5, 1975. Be it intentional or serendipitous, that’s a date which evokes the historical development of relations between people, government and money. On April 5, 1933, through Executive Order 6102, the U.S. government forbid its citizens from “hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates.” The aim was to artificially increase demand for its fiat currency at the expense of demand for gold. During the Bretton Woods era, only foreigners, and not U.S. citizens, were allowed to convert dollars into gold, which is arguably one of the system’s flaws. The order was reversed in 1975, making gold possession in the United States legal again.

He goes on to describe in spine-chillingly fortuitous fashion a money that requires no permission, and no central “authority.” Also read: Money Laundering Fines Worth Billions Help Bankers Avoid Prosecution and Unpleasant Labels  “I don’t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can’t take them violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something they can’t stop.” So spoke Friedrich Hayek in 1984. Reevaluating those words 35 years hence and it is hard not to interpret them in the context of Bitcoin. Hayek was not alone in predicting the coming phenomenon of crypto in the 1980s. The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto of 1988 also called it way beforehand. As did American economist Milton Friedman in 1999: The one thing that’s missing, but that will soon be developed, it’s a reliable e-cash. A method where buying on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B, without A knowing B or B knowing A. The way in which I can take a 20 dollar bill and hand it over to you and there’s no record of where it came from. And you may get that without knowing who I am. That kind of thing will develop on the Internet. The common thread among these striking predictions is, of course, the internet. Many thought it was crazy back in the early and mid-90s to talk of “working online” or “online shopping.” To try and imagine a permissionless future currency not regulated by the government would have been beyond the pale for most. And yet, bitcoin is here. They were right. Hayek was a key thinker and innovator of the Austrian school of economics. The Austrian system is a classic economic model in which government interference in the free market is undesired and viewed as harmful and illogical. The conflicting viewpoint and economic model which holds sway today, the Keynesian system, submits that governments must be actively involved in economies via centralized regulation and force-backed implementation of monetary policy. While the view of almost all modern nation states is that interest rates must be set via policy—this would, in fact, be defined as a form of policing—adherents to the Austrian School view the market as an organic entity functioning by its own natural rules. Boom and bust cycles in business, and things like stock market crashes are the natural consequence of artificially instituted credit bubbles.  Friedrich Hayek’s most important contribution to the Austrian school, arguably, is the concept known as the knowledge problem, or the “local knowledge problem.” A kind of derivative and extension of fellow Austrian School thinker Ludwig von Mises’ economic calculation problem, the knowledge problem deals with the fundamental dysfunction of central planning. In his 1945 work “The Use of Knowledge” Hayek states: …the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place. It is with respect to this that practically every individual has some advantage over all others because he possesses unique information of which beneficial use might be made, but of which use can be made only if the decisions depending on it are left to him or are made with his active cooperation. In this sense, centralized economic planning is doomed to fail. Whereas aggregated data, stats, and relatively “stable” numbers may present one picture, these are the effects of individual market actors and their demonstrated preferences, and not central planning. That is to say, relative stability is achieved as a byproduct of individual, independent, atomized market signals. This in spite — and not because — of central planning.  Unique, diverse knowledge possessed by each individual market actor (i.e. “The factory is out of nails, I must replace them” or “I could invent this great device, if only I had more affordable access to that specific resource”) cannot be processed, understood, or adequately detected by a synthetic, centrally regulated entity according to Austrian school thinking. Supply and demand cannot be “felt” accurately. Thus, huge boom and bust cycles are seen, and are considered relatively stable when in fact this is a kind of ex post facto approach to the data. In a very real sense, Austrian economic theory advocates decentralized, “permissionless” networks of nodes (autonomous market actors) much like bitcoin and the decentralized network of actors on the blockchain.  Though Keynesian policy currently holds sway, many take issue with the fact that prescribed government interference and assistance seems so often to take the form of disruptive market corrections. Hayek viewed economic cycles as signals that an organic adjustment was in progress. Much like a headache can signal dehydration or stress in the body, decreased demand and less spending signal hesitance on the part of market actors, and a call to readjust and recalibrate according to fresh, real-time market signals. As witnessed with the mega bank bailouts of recent times, however, this Austrian “bitter pill” is not really allowed to function. Instead, Keynesian economists create more credit (and debt which taxpayers must ultimately hold) to save bad actors and institutions that would have failed otherwise. The predictions of Hayek, Mises, Friedman, and their fellows stand in stark contrast to those of noted, award-winning Keynesians. Mises predicted the now-witnessed collapse of major socialist states choosing to ignore the economic calculation problem in modern times. Hayek and Friedman predicted — among other things — the advent of cryptocurrency. As for John Maynard Keynes, father of the Keynesian School, he predicted a 15-hour workweek back in 1930, as automation and a prevalence of riches would make toil unnecessary: But beyond this, we shall endeavour to spread the bread thin on the butter-to make what work there is still to be done to be as widely shared as possible. Three-hour shifts or a fifteen-hour week may put off the problem for a great while. For three hours a day is quite enough to satisfy the old Adam in most of us! The ‘Adam’ he speaks of is the Adam of the Christian Bible, who was cursed to work the ground for his sustenance and so habitually feels the need to toil. He goes on: “The love of money as a possession … will be recognised for what it is, a somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semi-criminal, semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease.” Almost 100 years out, one might wonder why the altruism supposedly being exercised by Keynesian central planners hasn’t kicked in for everyone yet. Some have argued it has, as there is now at least more of a chance that this or that average Joe could get rich and afford a 15-hour workweek. Whichever predictions one chooses to abide by, one thing is for sure: bitcoin is here, and it isn’t going away anytime soon.

After a meeting in Abuja held on June 29 between the 15 member-country regional bloc, the implementation of a new single currency, after debating the monetary unit for years, was agreed. Despite the eco discussion and economic uncertainty within the massive continent, Africans still have a deep interest in digital currencies. Also Read: Iranians Defy Warning and Share Pictures of Bitcoin Mining in Mosque Right now a number of countries within the great continent of Africa are facing economic uncertainty and have issues with their sovereign issued currencies. This can be seen in regions that are suffering from hyperinflation like South Sudan and Zimbabwe but also in countries dealing with wavering monetary unpredictability. Some nations are having troubles with their sovereign issued tender and citizens tend to use multiple currencies like the CFA franc, euro or U.S. dollar for trade. On Saturday, the 15 member-country regional bloc called the Economic Community for West African States (ECOWAS) agreed to issue a new fiat currency called the eco. The single currency has been discussed for a number of years and was supposed to be launched in 2000. Local media reports “a real firm political will” for the member countries to adopt a single monetary unit this time around. Some of the West African States use the CFA franc and six of the member countries, including Nigeria, Liberia, and Ghana, have been having multiple currency issues for quite some time. The ECOWAS leaders will collaborate with the West African Monetary Agency (WAMA) and the region’s central banks in order to speed things up for 2020 adoption. Eco is not going to be a digital currency nor will it use blockchain technology and the new fiat reserve aims to bolster cross border trade. “The single currency if properly implemented will improve trade by allowing specific countries to specialize at what they are good at, and exchange it for other goods that other countries in the bloc produce more efficiently,” economic analyst,Tokunbo Afikuyomi told the press on Monday. Meanwhile, digital assets are still trending in Africa compared to the rest of the world. As cryptocurrency prices have gained considerable value, Google Trends now shows a new upswing of interest for people searching the term “bitcoin.” The top three countries in the world reside within the African continent: Nigeria, South Africa, and Ghana respectively. When it comes to the term “buy bitcoin,” Nigeria and Ghana are the top two countries in the world as well. Moreover, last week Zimbabwe banned foreign currencies in the country and since then BTC prices in the region reportedly saw significant premiums on various trading platforms. Local.Bitcoin.com, the peer-to-peer marketplace that allows traders to swap fiat currencies for bitcoin cash, also has a slew of people buying and selling BCH in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Benin, Liberia, South Africa, and Burkina Faso. However, despite the fact that people are interested in digital currencies, Africans are still seeing a lack of progress. According to the Blockchain Association of Kenya, there’s been $1.5 million worth of digital assets traded in the country but “lack of education” is making adoption difficult. After Kaspersky released its Cryptocurrency Report 2019, Bethwel Opil, spokesperson at Kaspersky Africa, stated that the latest consumer survey in Africa agreed with the Blockchain Association of Kenya’s assessment. “The survey found that there is a desire amongst many consumers to use cryptocurrency, but a knowledge gap is getting in the way of taking the plunge,” the Kaspersky Africa correspondent wrote. “In addition, many people who thought they knew what they are dealing with, later decided against using cryptocurrency.” According to the report, a fifth of South African respondents (14%) explained that they stopped using digital currencies because they were “technically complicated.” Opil also said the lack of education brings scammers who prey on individuals who just recently learned about cryptocurrencies. The fraudsters, coupled with price volatility, are some of the biggest reasons Africans are so suspicious of digital currencies. “This lack of understanding could be leading to mistrust in cryptocurrencies’ ability to keep consumers’ money safe,” Opil added. Regardless, there’s still been massive interest stemming from the African continent as the staff columnist at Born 2 Invest explains, “there’s been an astronomical increase with regards to new users from Africa over the last year or so.” “It’s been estimated that transactions from South Africa have risen by 25%, and a 60% increase where Nigeria is concerned, whilst in other areas there were climbs of up to 100%,” the author reported. Cryptocurrency is the digital version of old Swiss Dinar: The unstoppable money circulating without the government\\'s consent. Watch #bitcoin usage and prices spike in Zimbabwe, where, like everywhere else, \"the full faith of government\" is just economic jargon. — \\'Laolu Samuel-Biyi (@samuel_biyi) June 24, 2019  With Ghana and Nigeria being members of the ECOWAS bloc and introducing the new fiat currency eco, it will be interesting to see how the government deals with all the cryptocurrency action taking place in those countries. According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), leaders who attended the 55th session in Abuja believe they finally made considerable progress on the single currency front. Nigeria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mustapha Suleiman, instructed the ECOWAS commission to work with various entities to accelerate the implementation of the eco currency. When governments usher in new fiat currency, they typically are opposed to foreign currencies much like the Venezuelan petro and the example in Zimbabwe last week. It’s quite possible that the introduction of the eco in 2020 could put a damper on some of the thriving cryptocurrency regions in Africa if they feel that their new eco money will be threatened.

The Iranian section of the website displays a short message that states that the exchange is “currently not available.” The news follows significant Iranian rial trade volume on the Localbitcoins platform, which has been climbing steadily over the last few weeks. Also read: Bitcoin Miner Recounts Struggle to Obtain Cheap Iranian Power The Helsinki-based BTC exchange Localbitcoins.com has stopped servicing Iranian residents but hasn’t disclosed why it made the decision. Over the last few weeks, however, tensions have been rising in the Middle East between Iran and the U.S. For instance, last week the U.S. military put regional soldiers on high alert and the State Department asked nonemergency federal employees to leave the country. The move from Localbitcoin.com is likely due to harsh economic sanctions leveled against Iran. The U.S. imposed sanctions against Iran in 1979 and since then members of the United Nations have also participated in trade bans. Over the last few years, reports have detailed that Iranian residents have been using cryptocurrencies to escape these sanctions so they can buy products and services overseas. BTC trade volumes stemming from the data aggregation website Coin Dance show that there’s been significant trading taking place in Iran up until Localbitcoins decided to geo-restrict the nation. The week of May 18 showed some of the highest levels of Iranian rial Localbitcoins volumes since the crypto bull run in 2017. Localbitcoins rial-measured trade volumes were steadily climbing for weeks leading up until the decision to stop service in the oil-rich nation. According to a screenshot of the Localbitcoins support team talking to an Iranian user, residents from the region have been told they can withdraw their BTC, but they cannot trade on the platform. When an individual visits the Iranian Localbitcoins URL there is a notice which states: Unfortunately, Localbitcoins is currently not available in your selected region — Please look for other location or come back later. Cryptocurrencies have become a popular medium of exchange in Iran, but regulatory uncertainty also stems from Iranian government officials and the country’s central bank. A few days ago on Bitcoin Pizza Day, a group of Iranians got together in Tehran to celebrate. The owner of the restaurant where the meetup took place, Reza Abdollahi, told the press: “We have up to 200 people paying with crypto each month, mostly consisting of large groups who throw parties at the restaurant to use the discount.” Abdollahi also said that a great majority of those payments derive from people using ethereum (ETH) as well. The Tehran-based Blockchain Academy educator, Tina Kheiri, added to the commentary by stating: Scores of people are mining cryptocurrencies and some businesspeople are using parts of their factories as mining farms, which I think is great under sanctions.  Iranians flocking to cryptos really started heating up after U.S. president Trump told the world he would withdraw the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal and reimpose far stricter economic sanctions. Additionally, miners stemming from China and other regions throughout the world have been moving operations to Iran for cheap electricity. Reports have noted that Chinese miners have found $0.006 per kilowatt-hour. Last December, Iranian college students used bitcoin to bypass economic sanctions to purchase school supplies and books. The Localbitcoins ban will be a deep blow to traders within the country seeking to acquire digital currency in a peer-to-peer fashion.

For example, since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009, some individuals have used digital currencies as a form of agorism otherwise known as counter-economics. These people believe that using bitcoin as a tool to avoid state harassment is one of the technology’s key features with the potential to reduce the manipulation and civil abuses perpetrated by government bureaucracy. Also read: This Short Animation Might Make You Think Twice About Taxes Since the creation of the Bitcoin network, many libertarians have flocked to this technology. Groups of ideologists who believe in free markets, anarcho-capitalism, and the protection of property rights have all called cryptocurrencies a tool that can be weaponized against central controllers of the world’s money. Agorists, in particular, appreciate cryptocurrencies as a means to avoid state harassment and civil abuses like taxation at all costs. Because digital currencies can be used in a private manner if the user desires then people who live counter-economically can stop funding wars, the police state, corruption, and the oligarchy.  Agorism stems from the Greek root word “agora,” which means “open markets” and the philosophy of counter-economics was first conceived by a libertarian philosopher named Samuel E Konkin III (SEK3). Konkin asserted that agorism is the ultimate strategy for living free because it involves any types of voluntary exchange, but makes sure the state is removed from the situation. “Everyone is a resister to the extent that he survives in a society where laws control everything and give contradictory orders — All (non-coercive) human action committed in defiance of the state constitutes the counter-economy,” explains Konkin’s Agorist Primer. Agorists partake in black markets and operate under the noses of the state in the gray area as well, which could mean avoiding taxes, dismissing the idea of permits and licenses, operating a business under the table, and circumventing regulations. Of course, using money is a big part of the ideological process as well and agorists prefer to settle exchanges by barter and trade, cash deals, and cryptocurrencies. The reason digital currencies like bitcoin are attractive to agorists is because the money is not issued by a central authority like a bank, no corporation is behind it, and most importantly it operates completely free from the state.  Satoshi spoke a few times on how bitcoin will not be the “ultimate solution to political problems,” but on Nov. 7, 2008, the digital currency’s creator insisted: “We can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.” Moreover, on Feb. 6, 2010, Satoshi recommended using Tor in order to add an extra layer of privacy to crypto transactions. “You could use Tor if you don’t want anyone to know you’re even using Bitcoin,” explained Nakamoto. “Bitcoin is still very new and has not been independently analysed — If you’re serious about privacy, Tor is an advisable precaution.” On Nov. 25, 2009, Satoshi stated: The possibility to be anonymous or pseudonymous relies on you not revealing any identifying information about yourself in connection with the bitcoin addresses you use. If you post your bitcoin address on the web, then you’re associating that address and any transactions with it with the name you posted under. If you posted under a handle that you haven’t associated with your real identity, then you’re still pseudonymous — For greater privacy, it’s best to use bitcoin addresses only once. There are many ways cryptocurrencies can be used to remove the state from consensual trades between individuals and many digital asset proponents believe this. Agorists also believe that vices are not crimes and label the drug war a crime against peaceful civilians. The founder of the Silk Road, ‘Dread Pirate Roberts’ (DPR), also believed in the anti-authoritarian stance involved with Agorism. “Every single transaction that takes place outside the nexus of state control is a victory for those individuals taking part in the transaction,” DPR stated back in 2012. “So there are thousands of victories here each week and each one makes a difference, strengthens the agora, and weakens the state.”  Many believe that anti-state activity tied to Bitcoin like Wikileaks and the Silk Road helped fuel the digital currency’s real-world value during the early days. Moreover, with the dozens of darknet markets and sectors such as gambling, gray and black activities are still very prevalent within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. There are some digital currency supporters begging for cryptocurrencies to be regulated and ‘defined’ by the state. However, like it or not, on the opposite side of the spectrum, many agorists are intentionally doing things with cryptocurrencies that are considered ‘bad mannered’ and ‘uncouth.’  Agorists and those who follow a sincere libertarian ideology believe that pro-state bitcoiners lack principles and the technology’s greatest expression of intentionality have always been anti-state. As the evolution of cryptocurrency grows more people who are anti-war, anti-state, and wholeheartedly believe in a society run by free markets will continue to be attracted to this technology.

However, they may not realize that virtual items like in-game gold from popular role-playing games (RPGs) like Runescape, Guild Wars, and World of Warcraft have been sold for bitcoins since 2012. Also read: Auscoin Exchange Suspended After Arrest of Sam Karagiozis Virtual items and in-game gold from some of the world’s most popular RPGs have been in high demand over the last decade. Global trade captures over $50 billion a year according to recent estimates. Selling virtual items and ‘gold farming’ is the act of playing a massively multiplayer online game (MMO) for hours in order to gather an in-game currency or items. In developing nations, there many businesses that cater to these sales and people have full-time positions as gold farmers. Some of the money that funds the in-game gold farming industry stems from cryptocurrency sales and these markets have been intertwined for the last seven years. Gold farming and cryptocurrencies have been in the headlines in recent months because some Venezuelans have been selling in-game currencies for crypto in order to survive. Only recently the price of Runescape Dragon Bones plummeted when Venezuelans lost electricity but saw a 10 percent spike on March 12. There have been many reports of citizens from the region gold farming all types of games to escape poverty. On June 10, 2018, a Venezuelan doing an AMA on Reddit explained that it’s an ordinary occurrence for people to sell in-game currencies for digital currencies. “It’s normal, yes, Venezuelans farm Runescape gold, World of Warcraft gold, and then exchange for crypto or USD/local currency,” they responded when asked if gold farming was prevalent in the region. “Some people do the same thing to other games like Guild Wars or Tibia.” In October last year Amazon gave away a discounted Runescape signup and more than two-thirds of the registrants stemmed from Venezuela. 29-year-old Efrain Peña explained to Bloomberg in December 2017 that he played the game to support his wife and child. “We’ve never made this much before,” Peña described.  Many people don’t realize that there are lots of marketplaces online that buy and sell Runescape gold RS3, OSRS, WOW gold, and many other types of in-game items for digital currencies. For instance, you can sell OSRS, RS3, and Runescape gold for BTC at the marketplace Piegp.com. There’s also Food4rs, Boglagold, Wowhead, Papusgold, Gran Mercado, and many more exchanges that deal with in-game gold trades. Exchanges like these have existed for years and gamers have been selling virtual MMO items for cryptocurrencies since 2012.  Back then people used to sell World of Warcraft items like WOW gold on a bitcoin marketplace called Bitmet.net. In February of that year, a user on Bitmet.net was selling 10,000 WOW for 1 BTC and people were purchasing the in-game gold. Of course, with today’s BTC prices no one would ever do that as 10,000 WOW gold is only worth $0.30 cents today. And even back then those 10,000 WOW were still pretty expensive as the exchange rate for 1 BTC at the time was only $5.60 making one WOW worth $0.06. It goes to show that gold farming and in-game currencies for the web’s top MMOs and RPGs have always had a strong relationship with cryptocurrencies since the early days and these markets are still thriving today.

Keeping all of his money in bitcoin, he only exchanges small amounts into the hyperinflating bolivar when necessary. Also read: SEC Chair Explains Key Upgrades Needed for Bitcoin ETF Approval Carlos Hernández, a Venezuelan living in Ciudad Guayana, told his story in The New York Times on Saturday about how bitcoin is saving his family throughout the ongoing crisis in Venezuela. Citing the bolivar’s daily inflation rate of around 3.5 percent, he wrote: I don’t own bolívars, Venezuela’s official currency. I keep all of my money in bitcoin. Keeping it in bolívars would be financial suicide. He explained that he does not have a bank account abroad and “With Venezuela’s currency controls, there’s no easy way for me to use a conventional foreign currency like American dollars.”  Hernández revealed that cryptocurrency has enabled him to cover his household expenses on his own, noting that his father, a government employee, earns $6 a month and his stay-at-home mom has no income. His brother also relies on cryptocurrency. Juan, a 28-year-old lawyer, became a freelancer because “in times of hyperinflation, everyone is constantly getting poorer, including a lawyer’s clients,” Hernández detailed. He added that his brother “had to turn to cryptocurrencies to get paid” because he could not use Paypal, a common way for websites to pay freelancers, due to “exchange controls here allow[ing] Venezuelan banks to use only local currency.” Moreover, cryptocurrency helped Juan avoid his money being seized at the borders when he tried to move to Colombia. “Venezuelan military personnel at the borders have a reputation for seizing the money of people who want to leave,” Hernández exclaimed. Overall, he concluded: You could say that cryptocurrencies have saved our family. In order to buy everyday necessities such as milk, Hernández explained that cryptocurrencies must be converted into bolivars. He uses Localbitcoins to find buyers who use the same bank he does so “the wire transfer can go through immediately,” he said, elaborating: I can’t change too many bitcoins at once, though. The government doesn’t monitor cryptocurrency transactions (yet), but it does monitor transactions in bolívars — and any worth about $50 or more will automatically freeze your account until you can explain to your bank where the funds come from. Localbitcoins has been a popular platform for Venezuelans. The trading volume on the exchange has been steadily rising, hitting a record high of 2,487 BTC for the week ending Feb. 9 before settling at 1,939 BTC last week.  Another international exchange platform, Paxful, told news.Bitcoin.com last week that it also saw record volume in Venezuela, which increased 74.66 percent compared to last year. In addition, the number of trades on the platform increased by 118 percent to an average of 61,534 transactions monthly. Recently the government of Nicolas Maduro published decrees to regulate crypto activities in Venezuela, including taxing remittances. Like Hernández, charities in Venezuela have also been able to benefit from bitcoin’s borderless nature. One such charity is Bitcoin Venezuela, a nonprofit organization that uses bitcoin to raise funds to aid Venezuelans while offering education in basic economics.  For Venezuela’s International Children’s Day last year, the nonprofit’s humanitarian aid project collected bitcoin donations from Paxful and others. It then gave food to a soup kitchen that feeds 1,500 people daily, two orphanages, and distributed hundreds of meals to people on the street. On Feb. 10, Eatbch, a Venezuelan nonprofit food drive powered by bitcoin cash, celebrated its one-year anniversary.

Now after some deliberation, New Hampshire’s House Subcommittee unanimously approved the state’s bitcoin for taxes bill.

Over the last few weeks, the state’s legislators have been discussing the recently submitted bill, HB 470, which would allow residents to pay specific New Hampshire taxes with bitcoin. HB 470 will address any accounting, valuation and management issues related to accepting cryptocurrencies, the bill states. Further, the plan will need to find a third party payment processor that will process digital asset transactions at no cost to the state. “Implementation Plan for the State to Accept Cryptocurrencies as Payment for Taxes and Fees,” explains HB 470. “The state treasurer, in consultation with the commissioner of the department of revenue administration and the commissioner of the department of administrative services, shall develop an implementation plan for the state to accept cryptocurrencies as payment for taxes and fees beginning July 1, 2020.” If the bill passes, then on or before November 1, 2019, the state treasurer must submit the roadmap to the Governor, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Senate President, the House Clerk, the Senate Clerk, and the offices of the State Library. On Jan. 29, 2019 at 9 a.m., the New Hampshire House Subcommittee unanimously approved the bitcoin for taxes legislation and the bill’s amendments. HB 470 will now go back to the executive branches like the state’s Administration Committee for further voting. New Hampshire is currently on the move to join Ohio, the first state in the U.S. to accept payments in bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin core (BTC) for 23 types of business taxes. “Ohio has become the first state in the United States, and one of the first governments in the world, to accept cryptocurrency,” detailed Josh Mandel from the Ohio Treasurer’s Office at the time. Then there’s the state of Indiana which plans to amend the tax code and accept cryptocurrencies for tax payments as well, according to House bill number 1683 filed on Jan. 24, 2019. Indiana’s Treasurer will be in charge of handling similar parts of the system, like finding a payment processor, but if enacted, Indiana’s amended tax code would go into effect on July 1, 2019. With the New Hampshire Subcommittee unanimously pushing through the bitcoin for taxes bill, it seems like the state may approve the legislation in the near future, although residents will still have to wait until 2020 in order to pay taxes with cryptocurrencies. HB 470 also emphasizes that New Hampshire will not accept the responsibility of bitcoin’s price fluctuations and all taxes collected will be converted to U.S. dollars immediately. Furthermore, the state’s Treasury is unable to predict whether a third-party payment processor would process cryptocurrency services at no cost to the state, the proposed bill concedes.

Pro-regulation industry participants have described the move as a key step towards legitimizing crypto assets. The registration process includes performing background checks and other anti-money laundering procedures on the entities involved. Also read: Coincheck Registers 1.7M New Users Since Resuming Operations  Australia amended its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism laws last year, making it a requirement for digital asset exchanges to register with Austrac, the country’s top financial intelligence agency. According to a report published by public broadcaster ABC on Jan. 31 , the agency has also investigated 11 crypto trading platforms and eventually declined two registrations between April 2018, when the changes took effect, and mid-January 2019. No reasons were given for the refusal.  Exchanges had until October to fully comply with the new Austrac rules, including reporting suspicious transactions believed to be potentially linked to money laundering or terrorist funding. The article quoted an unnamed Austrac official who warned: “We will not hesitate to take strong enforcement action where significant or wilful non-compliance is identified.” Pro-regulation observers in Australia believe the mandatory registration of cryptocurrency exchanges will lend more legitimacy to digital currency enterprises as well as blockchain projects. Phillippa Ryan, a cryptocurrency researcher at the University of Technology Sydney, told ABC that regulation helped delegitimize “the cowboys and the shonky operators.” She argues that shoddy exchanges damage public trust in cryptocurrencies. A succession of multi-million dollar hacks within the crypto industry has sometimes led to investors questioning the safety of their assets held by exchanges. But every investor knows there is a latent degree of risk involved when storing funds with a third party. Ryan, who has links with the Australian Digital Commerce Association, is looking forward to a time when government will re-assess its treatment of cryptocurrencies. She detailed: You need to start at the beginning, with all the regulation you need and no more to support innovation and protect investors. Then you let it run … [and] start legislating as things go wrong and you learn lessons. The decision by Austrac may also have been necessitated by other factors. For example, Australia’s competition regulator last year received more than 6,000 reports of potential scams linked to virtual currencies. Losses were reported to have totalled more than $9.5 million, much of it investment scams. There were also other concerns about initial coin offerings, some of which turned out to be elaborate get-rich-quick schemes.  “We always had the feeling that regulation is important to bring cryptocurrency into the mainstream,” said Adrian Przelozny, head of local cryptocurrency trading platform Independent Reserve, as quoted by ABC. He added: “If you look back two or three years, it was quite easy for anyone to start their own exchange. It was really up to the consumer to do their own research to see if the exchange they were interacting with was one they could trust.” What do you think about the regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges?

Worries about a global recession have been fed by the newly published GDP report showing that China grew at its slowest rate last year since 1990. If a global recession were to happen in the future, many believe that cryptocurrencies, bitcoin primarily, would benefit. Also Read:\\xa0Davos 2019: Leaders Share Mixed Cryptocurrency Predictions There are a number of indicators pointing\\xa0to a potential economic downturn. In its World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund\\xa0(IMF) warned\\xa0a no-deal Brexit could be a severe shock to the British economy.\\xa0An escalation of Trump’s trade war with China is also another threat.\\xa0\\xa0 The IMF has shared its financial market sentiment stating: “Escalating trade tensions, together with concerns about Italian fiscal policy, worries regarding several emerging markets, and, toward the end of the year, about a U.S. government shutdown, contributed to equity price declines during the second half of 2018. A range of catalyzing events in key systemic economies could spark a broader deterioration in investor sentiment and a sudden, sharp repricing of assets amid elevated debt burdens.” Statistics released on Jan. 21 show\\xa0China’s GDP growth slowed to 6.6 percent year on year in 2018, the slowest pace since 1990. If we continue to see a significant decline in economic activity what could this mean for cryptocurrencies? Ciaran Hynes, managing partner at Cosimo Ventures, opined: “Depending on when a recession hits and what its causes are, cryptocurrencies could experience several effects. If a recession were to happen in traditional markets in the near future, and the causes are related to excessive contraction of the dollar money supply, which was a big part of the 2008 crisis, then you probably get a rush to scarce cash and decline in relative market value of all assets that are liquid, such as gold.” Hynes explained that all unstable cryptocurrencies could fall hard and there could be a surge to the higher quality dollar-pegged stablecoins. Many crypto holders will not want to cross over into fiat, and we may even see a market premium for these stablecoins. “Weaker dollar-pegged stable coins — ones that are algorithmic only, or don’t have a transparent 100% reserve of actual dollars behind them — may be tested or even shorted until they collapse,” added\\xa0Hynes. If the next recession happens later or is caused by other factors, such as loss of confidence in the U.S. dollar itself, then we may see very different outcomes from those postulated above. Hynes predicted:  Cryptocurrencies would likely be welcomed and pushed higher as an alternative to the U.S. dollar.\\xa0 As a result, all dollar-pegged stablecoins might then be sold off heavily and tested on their ability to store value. If a global recession were to impact the value of government-issued currencies and their purchasing power, we would likely see an exodus into real world assets such as gold, shared\\xa0Kai C. Chng, CEO of Digix,\\xa0an asset tokenization company.\\xa0 Chng said: “Precious metals have been a historic safe haven in times of economic uncertainty and are largely resilient to the fluctuations of international monetary markets. Should a global recession impact the purchasing power of traditional currencies, for those who already understand the benefits presented by cryptocurrency, we would expect to see increased interest in owning bitcoin, while those who are currently ill-acquainted with the cryptocurrency market are likely to show new interest in entering the space.“ According to Bitmex Research, bitcoin has traded like a safe heaven asset from 2011 to 2013. After that point it seemed to take on attributes of a “risk on” asset, for instance a very strong performance in 2017 alongside large cap Chinese tech stocks. Bitmex Research states that a flight to safety and liquidity now would prove negative for bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices. If bitcoin was able to shift again and rally as a safe heaven asset in a deleveraging environment, however, that would be very positive news for bitcoin. The research group noted though that it has yet to see any evidence of that yet. Will cryptocurrencies become a hedge against economic meltdown? Robert Viglione, co-founder of Horizen, said: “As much as I want to believe that cryptocurrencies are the ideal disaster asset, we really don’t have enough data to draw that conclusion.” He\\xa0added: It makes some sense in that bitcoin returns have zero covariance with any other asset class thus far, but we only have about 10 years of data. My hunch is that as crypto markets mature, they’re going to start picking up some general market correlation. For now, however, crypto is at least a decent hedge on all of the macroeconomic insanity. Ned Myers, head of product at Alphapoint, a provider of distributed ledger technology, explained that when we think of the state of digital assets in the context of a potential recession, there are two considerations that come to mind:\\xa0\\xa0 Many crypto advocates will be hoping that the next recession helps push cryptocurrency into the mainstream. During economic turmoil, investors will always flock towards safe haven assets that are largely resilient to fluctuations of international monetary markets.

One business that was once incredibly popular is the art of manufacturing loaded physical bitcoins. Government regulations have forced operations to cease, causing the physical bitcoin minting business to virtually grind to a halt.   Also read: 8 Crypto Debit Cards You Can Use Around the World Right Now  Not long after Bitcoin was launched, people managed to create paper wallets and soon the concept of physical bitcoins was born. After that, individuals took the idea to another level and minted metal bitcoins were created. Casascius coins quickly became a collector’s item with these shiny keepsakes loaded with digital currency. However, after Mike Caldwell, the creator of Casascius coins, started selling his physical bitcoins loaded with whole units or fractions of BTC, he was shut down by the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The U.S. regulator considered minting Casascius coins illegal money transmission and Caldwell had to stop selling loaded coins. Since then a number of other manufacturers have attempted to sell loaded bitcoins to investors who may find numismatic value in these physical collections. From 2013-2016, physical bitcoins were extremely popular and demand for these coins has remained robust among collectors. Some rare Casascius coins have sold for more than 4-10X their loaded value. In the early days there were so many physical bitcoins that cryptocurrency proponent Elias Ahonen managed to author an entire encyclopedia of physical bitcoins. In recent years, however, the art of molding loaded physical bitcoins is all but lost. Companies like Ravenbit, Alitin Mint, Cryptmint and Titan Bitcoin have all gone out of business. Last April the Japanese manufacturer Satori Coin told customers it was forced to close operations due to the Financial Services Agency’s AML/KYC standards introduced in 2018. Similarly, the cryptocurrency firm BTCC launched its own physical bitcoin forge and ended its operations in October 2018. Bobby Lee, the co-founder of the company, explained to his Twitter followers how BTCC Mint’s physical bitcoin sales in China touched record highs before it closed operations. The mint did manage to produce a 2018 series, which is still available to U.S. customers through a company called Rogue Bitcoin. In fact, there are plenty of physical bitcoins for sale on secondary markets as third parties have managed to hoard these coins and sell them for a profit. On Ebay, and many other auction and e-commerce websites, there are plenty of Casascius, Satori, Titan, and BTCC loaded coins. However, collectors will find that prices are way higher than what the coin was sold for originally and well above what it holds digitally. The biggest reason for most of these firms going out of business is predominately overreaching regulation. The U.S. government, for instance, may be okay with people exchanging cryptocurrency in a regulated manner digitally. However, issuing physical bitcoins that are loaded or any other type of manufactured bearer bond instrument that competes with the U.S. dollar is not a good idea and you could wind up in prison.  This can also happen to coin creators even if the products are minted without digitally loaded value inside them. On March 18, 2011, the U.S. government convicted 67-year old Bernard von Nothaus for being the monetary architect of a currency. Essentially von Nothaus’s “Liberty Dollar” operations ended immediately and U.S. Attorney Anne Tompkins did not take kindly to the creation. “Attempts to undermine the legitimate currency of this country are simply a unique form of domestic terrorism,” Tompkins explained at the time.  There are plenty of coin makers that sell metal ‘bitcoins’ with no digital funds, but there is one company that still issues physical bitcoins that are loaded. Denarium sells a variety of pre-funded physical coins in bronze, silver, and even .999 gold. The pieces are made by a Finnish company called Prasos and private keys are covered by a tamper-resistant hologram. Some of Denarium’s products have units like 1 BTC tied to them, while with other types of coins, the customer can add a custom sum. The Denarium Custom Gold Plated 2018 piece can be loaded with fractions of BTC and up to a maximum of 2 BTC per coin. Besides Denarium and overpriced secondary markets, finding physical cryptocurrency manufacturers who are willing to sell coins loaded, unfortunately, is now all but impossible.

The same can be said of projected cryptocurrency prices as the bear market continues.\\xa0 Natalia Karayaneva, CEO of real estate startup Propy, highlights a number of issues which need to be addressed when buying and selling property using crypto. “The main issue we’ve experienced is exchanging large amounts because sellers, very often, want to to get paid in fiat,” she explains. “When payment is crypto to crypto, large amounts have to be sent in smaller portions as transactions are not reversible. This is because sending large amounts of crypto is still a risky process e.g. if a hacker swaps a public address, the transaction is not reversible,” noted Karayaneva.  Karayaneva explained that Propy also educates various title or escrow companies on processing such deals as a majority of them do not want to touch crypto. A\\xa0title\\xa0company is one which issues title\\xa0insurance policies, while an\\xa0escrow\\xa0agency attends to the many details involved in opening, maintaining, and closing a real estate sale transaction. “Additionally, when you buy real estate using cryptocurrency it’s a taxable event, unlike the myth amongst some investors that using bitcoin will eliminate taxes – not true,” stressed Karayaneva.\\xa0 The primary challenge her group has faced is educating all participants involved in a deal, including agents and title agents, to properly prepare legal documents for U.S. and EU deals. So far Propy has facilitated deals in the US, EU, and Ukraine, with payment in ETH-ETH, BTC-BTC, BTC-fiat, and fiat-fiat.

Although I love cryptocurrency, I was unsure with the request, as I did not know the person. Since trust here was more important than profit I refused at that time. If I had any way of checking the trustworthiness of the person, I would have made the deal. There are still many factors hindering the renting or buying of real estate properties directly using crypto. Stefan Neagu, co-founder of digital identify management system\\xa0Persona, said: “The first aspect is the volatility of the market. In order to not be affected by the volatility, the price would need to be set or agreed in USD or EUR, but payable in crypto.” He identified another issue in that the person who receives the crypto as payment may have a hard time declaring those amounts to government fiscal agencies. ”Both aspects have a common factor however – the source of funds. Renting/buying properties with crypto would be the choice (I assume) of money launderers using funds from illegal activities, due to the lack of possibilities to prove the source of funds,” added\\xa0Neagu. Neagu explained that it is likely the majority of the people who would want to rent or buy real estate properties would not insist on paying with crypto.\\xa0 Even if they choose to purchase properties with crypto, they would have to undergo the necessary KYC/AML\\xa0in order to be able to move large amounts of money from cryptocurrency to EUR or USD.  Neagu noted: “With the right tools or applications, the owner could be in the position to check the source of funds, but even so, there are a lot of extra steps required to access crypto.

Since then, the seven-day simple moving average (SMA) shows that the network has decreased by at least 74 EH/s over the past week. Just a week ago, Bitcoin’s hashrate, according to the seven-day SMA, reached a lifetime peak of 656 EH/s. Today, on June 3, the network’s computational power stands at 582 EH/s after dropping by 74 EH/s. To illustrate, if the average mining machine contributing computational power to the Bitcoin network produces an estimated 200 terahash per second (TH/s), then a loss of 74 EH/s would mean around 370,000 miners of the 200 TH/s capacity went offline.  Over the past 100 blocks, block intervals, or the time between each block mined, have been very close to the ten-minute average. The average block interval over the past 100 blocks has been approximately 9 minutes and 55 seconds. For example, the block time between block height 846,350 mined by Antpool and block 846,351 discovered by Braiins Pool was about 10 minutes and 21 seconds. The network’s next difficulty retarget is expected on or around June 5, 2024, and based on the average over the past 2,016 blocks, a modest increase is anticipated. At present, the network’s hashprice, or the expected value of 1 petahash per second (PH/s) of hashing power per day, is valued at $55.63. This is an improvement from the $45 range per petahash but significantly lower than before the fourth halving event. A few factors can assist bitcoin miners besides enhancing efficiency, including an increase in BTC’s price per unit. While that alone would boost the hashprice higher, escalated fees would also add to revenue. However, miners are currently experiencing subpar market values since BTC’s all-time high in March and much lower fees since the halving. An expected 1.61% difficulty rise, as estimated by btc.com’s difficulty data page, would not help miners much, but the difficulty would still be below the all-time high set on April 24. Although not fully reflected yet, hashrate reduction can temporarily extend the time it takes to find the next block since the difficulty remains initially unchanged. This means if block intervals continue to rise, the expected 1.61% difficulty increase could drop to a much lower figure or even result in an overall decrease in difficulty come June 5.

Bitcoin miners generated 46.15% less revenue in May compared to April, according to the theblock.co data. Miners earned $964.24 million from block subsidies and fees in May. Onchain fees were $64.85 million in May, significantly lower than the $281.47 million accrued in April. This marked the lowest earnings since October 2023, when miners accumulated $864 million. Last month, 4,281 blocks were discovered, with Foundry USA leading the way by finding 1,243 blocks, accounting for over 29% of the total.

The operation, carried out in the city of Saltos de Guaira and situated near a national power facility, was deemed by authorities as the largest operation of its kind. Paraguay continues to crack down on illegal mining activities that siphon power from the country’s electric grid. In an operation executed in Saltos de Guaira on May 28, the Paraguayan National Power Administration (ANDE) and local prosecutors detected and pulled the plug on a giant bitcoin mining farm hosting 2,738 bitcoin miners. While many of these machines were disconnected, the farm had bypassed the connection to the electric meter, obtaining the energy for the operation without being accounted by ANDE. In addition to the bitcoin miners, authorities confiscated five electric transformers with a total installed capacity of 7,150 kilo-volt-amperes. The detection of this farm was possible due to the implementation of several techniques, including supervisory and control systems (SCADA) and artificial intelligence (AI) software to monitor the load current peaks. This process was complemented with thermal drones, which found hot spots in the area, giving authorities the means to act. The equipment is currently under the custody of a joint task force, that will transport the equipment to an ANDE facility for its safekeeping. The detection of this kind of operation located less than 2.5 kilometers from a local power plant has prompted suspicions of the direct involvement of ANDE officials in its setup. In a press release, the Paraguayan state company reported an internal auditing process to detect if this is the case and take action if employees are facilitating these operations.

Despite the initial rejection from Bitfarms’ Board, the proposal will be directly presented to shareholders. Riot asserts that the acquisition will establish a vertically integrated, geographically diversified operation with robust financial backing for growth plans. Riot Platforms Inc. (Nasdaq: RIOT) announced Tuesday that it has made a proposal to acquire Bitfarms Ltd. (Nasdaq/TSX: BITF) “to create the world’s largest publicly listed bitcoin miner.” Under the proposal, Riot will acquire all outstanding shares of Bitfarms for $2.30 per share, representing a 24% premium over Bitfarms’ one-month average share price. Riot has also accumulated a 9.25% stake in Bitfarms, becoming its largest shareholder. The offer, valued at approximately $950 million in total equity, includes cash and Riot stock, potentially giving Bitfarms shareholders 17% of the combined company. Benjamin Yi, Executive Chairman of Riot, stated: A combination of Bitfarms and Riot would create the premier and largest publicly listed Bitcoin miner globally, with geographically diversified operations well-positioned for long-term growth. The proposed combination is advantageous for shareholders of both companies, Riot explained, adding that this acquisition would form a vertically integrated bitcoin mining company with up to 1.5 GW of power capacity and 52 EH/s self-mining capacity by year-end. The combined entity would operate 15 facilities across the U.S., Canada, Paraguay, and Argentina, offering geographic diversification and favorable energy arrangements. “Riot is confident that a combined company will drive further strategic and financial benefits to both sets of shareholders,” the company asserted. Initially, the proposal was submitted privately to the Bitfarms Board on April 22. However, it was rejected without meaningful engagement, Riot described. Recent allegations from a lawsuit by Bitfarms’ terminated CEO raise concerns about the directors’ commitment to shareholders’ best interests. Consequently, Riot is presenting its proposal directly to Bitfarms shareholders. Following the Annual General and Special Meeting on May 31, Riot plans to call a Special Meeting to introduce new independent directors to the Bitfarms Board.

The ministry, which recently declared that it would disconnect all bitcoin miners due to its high energy consumption, has already confiscated over 17,000 miners from several mining farms. The Venezuelan government is strengthening its crusade against bitcoin mining. Venezuelan authorities, including local police, intelligence officials, the state-owned power company Corpoelec, and the National Power Ministry, have executed two new operations in two states of the country, seizing over 6,000 miners in these procedures. The first operation was completed in the Portuguesa state, where authorities confiscated 5,995 bitcoin miners disconnected from the power grid, preventing its possible connection. Also, 293 miners were disconnected and seized in another operation executed in the Cojedes state, where energy connection equipment was also confiscated. These actions are part of a plan announced by the National Power Ministry that seeks to disconnect all bitcoin mining operations to lighten the energy load of these machines on the power system. The country is facing an energy crisis causing constant blackouts in several states. Authorities have yet to specify if this ban will continue to be enacted after the power crisis subsides, or if it will be definitive. Earlier reports indicate that over 11,000 bitcoin miners had been disconnected and seized by May 20th just in the Carabobo state, one of the country’s industrial centers. With these new operations, the total number of miners disconnected went over 17,000. Venezuela was one of the pioneer countries regarding cryptocurrency and mining regulation. Nonetheless, since the intervention of Sunacrip, the national cryptocurrency enforcer, and the arrest of Joselit Ramirez, its former head, the attitude of the national government towards the industry has changed. According to several reports, Ramirez was instrumental in intermediating unregistered sales of sanctioned Venezuelan oil for cryptocurrency, enabling a $20 billion internal embezzlement and money laundering scheme that is still being investigated.

It is now essential to ensure electricity is inexpensive and machines are efficient in terms of joules per terahash. The following is an examination of today’s top six ASIC miners in terms of profitability, just over a month after the fourth halving event. As May draws to a close, Bitcoin’s network hashprice, or the anticipated value of 1 petahash per second (PH/s) of hashing power, is slightly above $53 per petahash. Lately, miners have been earning an average of 3.3022 BTC per block since the halving, which includes the subsidy and fees. On average, bitcoin miners are receiving about 0.1772 BTC in fees. This development has noticeably impacted BTC’s mining profitability, considering that the subsidy alone was 6.25 BTC before Apr. 19. In essence, with reduced profits, today’s leading mining machines generate significantly less revenue compared to the past. According to data collected on May 24, 2024, at $0.12 per kilowatt hour (kWh), only three ASIC machines are turning a profit. If the operational expenditure (OPEX) drops to $0.04 per kWh, more than three dozen machines can achieve daily profits ranging from $0.20 to nearly $14. Microbt’s Whatsminer M63S can earn approximately $13.83 per day with an OPEX of $0.04 per kWh. The M63S features a hydro cooling system, enhancing energy efficiency and environmental protection through immersion mining. The M63S delivers an estimated 390 terahash per second (TH/s) with an energy efficiency of around 18.5 joules per terahash (J/T). Following closely on May 24 is Bitmain’s Antminer S21 Hydro, another ASIC miner utilizing a hydro cooling system, generating an estimated $12.69 under current hashprice conditions. It offers a hashrate of around 335 TH/s and a power consumption of approximately 5,360 watts. The Antminer S21 Hydro’s energy efficiency stands at around 16 J/T. Next is the Microbt Whatsminer M63 hydro-cooled mining rig, providing 334-366 TH/s of hashrate. This machine’s energy efficiency is rated at 19.9 J/T, yielding an estimated $11.40 per day in profit with an OPEX of $0.04 per kWh. Additionally, Microbt’s Whatsminer M66S, another hydro ASIC rig, produces between 298-312 TH/s and earns about $10.57 per day under current hashprice conditions. Rounding out the top five is the Whatsminer M66, which also features a hydro cooling system and delivers an estimated 280 TH/s, resulting in an estimated $9.56 per day in profits. Bitmain’s Antminer S21 Pro ranks as the sixth most profitable miner at present and is the only air-cooled bitcoin (BTC) miner on the list. This machine generates 234 TH/s with an energy efficiency ratio of 15 J/T, earning an estimated $9.07 per day with the current hashprice of 1 petahash. Other notable rigs in the top ten include the Antminer S19 XP Hydro (255 TH/s), the Antminer T19 Pro Hydro (235 TH/s), Microbt’s Whatsminer M53S (260 TH/s), and the Antminer S21 (200 TH/s). It is clear that hydro miners are leading the way under current conditions, with Whatsminer and Antminer hydro models dominating the top ten most profitable bitcoin miners. The energy efficiency and cooling systems of these rigs are proving beneficial in terms of profitability. As OPEX continues to be a crucial factor, miners are striving to balance performance and efficiency to sustain viable operations. Moving forward, it will be fascinating to observe how hydro mining technology evolves and shapes the future of bitcoin mining. What do you think about the top six bitcoin miners today?

In less than a week, two new illegal bitcoin mining operations have been closed with over 550 miners seized, causing undetermined damages to the National Power Administration (ANDE). Paraguay is seeking to thwart the illegal bitcoin mining business in its country. Paraguayan authorities have intensified their efforts to crack down on bitcoin mining activities that siphon power from the country’s power grid directly, seeking to avoid paying the electric power fees. According to local news, National Power Administration (ANDE) officials found two bitcoin mining farms using artificial intelligence (AI) software and their distribution maps. The first of these operations was executed on May 19th in the Paraguari department, where 396 bitcoin miners were seized alongside other equipment that facilitated the conduction of these activities. The second of these seizures was conducted in the Canindeyu department on May 22, where in the same fashion, power measurement equipment was bypassed to obtain energy without paying the fees associated with the mining activity. At this second site, ANDE officials, police, and the local prosecutor’s office seized two transformers of 1,000 KVA each, which represents 2,000 KVA of power, and 176 Bitcoin mining machines. ANDE will estimate the damage caused by these operations to the grid and collect stolen energy fees from the responsible, alongside the fines associated with the crimes registered, which include illegal theft of electrical energy, disruption of public service, and sabotage. These actions are consistent with the recent change of heart of the Paraguayan government regarding bitcoin mining, urging lawmakers to pass a bill imposing harsh penalties for illegal miners. If approved, the proposed regulation would impose jail sentences of up to 10 years, offering ANDE more tools to fight these operations misusing the country’s power capacity.

On May 23, 2024, at block 844,704, the difficulty adjusted from 83.14 trillion to 84.38 trillion. This rise follows a 5.62% decrease on May 9, 2024, coinciding with a hashprice lower than pre-halving levels. Hashprice refers to the estimated value of one petahash per second (PH/s) of hashing power per day. Prior to the halving, it was just over $100 per PH/s, but it dropped to below $45. On May 23, 2024, with BTC’s value improving, the hashprice was approximately $54.85 at 12 a.m. EDT. As the hashprice decreased, the overall hashrate fell from 645 EH/s to a low of 582 EH/s, according to the seven-day simple moving average (SMA). When it hit 582 EH/s, BTC’s price was slightly above $60,000. The price is now more than $9,000 higher, which has driven up the hashprice. Consequently, the hashrate has rebounded to over 600 EH/s. The recent increase in Bitcoin’s mining difficulty and overall hashrate indicates a positive trend in the BTC mining ecosystem. The rise to 84.38 trillion at block height 844,704, following the previous significant drop, suggests a recovering network. Despite the hashprice being lower than pre-halving levels, the current $54.85 per petahash, up from under $45, signals a promising recovery.

Authorities have seized over 11,000 bitcoin miners as the government seeks to reduce the power usage from high-power customers siphoning energy from the national electric system. The Venezuelan National Power Ministry disclosed an operation to supervise the activities of high-power customers connected to the national power grid, including bitcoin miners. On social media, the ministry stated that this plan aimed to “disconnect all cryptocurrency mining farms in the country from the electrical system, avoiding the high impact on demand” produced by these activities. Rafael Lacava, governor of the state of Carabobo, where a large part of the industrial complex of the country resides, led a series of actions that concluded in the seizure of over 11,000 ASICs and the disconnection of an undetermined number of cryptocurrency mining farms. The actions would focus on reducing the energy destined for these activities as the country faces constant blackouts derived from deficiencies in power generation due to several climate and sanctions-related challenges. Lacava stated miners couldn’t keep their operations while the general population faced continuous energy interruptions. However, authorities did not clarify if these actions were definitive or if these would be applied just as the national electric system is adjusted to produce more energy. Governor Lacava declared that many more bitcoin mining farms would be disconnected and that other measures, including a national executive order to reduce the energy consumption of state agencies, would be announced in the next few days. These actions offer insight into the cryptocurrency mining industry in Venezuela after the disconnection of several bitcoin mining farms when Sunacrip, the national crypto watchdog, was linked to a corruption scheme involving the sale of sanctioned oil for cryptocurrency. Since then, Sunacrip has been facing restructuring activities and there is currently no clarity on the legality of the cryptocurrency mining activity in the country. The former president of Sunacrip, Joselit Ramirez, and the former President of state-owned oil company PDVSA, Tareck El Aissami, have been arrested and are currently under the custody of national authorities.

The recent rise in bitcoin’s price has positively influenced the overall hashprice as the value of 1 petahash per second (PH/s) daily has climbed above the $50 mark. Bitcoin’s hashrate represents the computational power dedicated to securing BTC blocks on the network, rewarding bitcoin miners with 3.125 BTC and the fees tied to the particular block they uncover. The seven-day SMA from Luxor’s hashrateindex.com indicates that on April 27, 2024, the hashrate was steady at 647 EH/s. Eighteen days later, on May 15, the hashrate had dipped to approximately 592 EH/s, having dropped to a low of 582 EH/s on May 8. By analyzing 417 blocks from block heights 843,210 to 843,627, covering a span from May 13 through May 15, data shows that miners received an average of 3.293 BTC per block. This average comprises not just the 3.125 BTC block subsidy but also approximately 0.168 BTC in fees per block mined. May is shaping up to be a month of lower earnings for miners, with revenues totaling $411.28 million over the first 15 days. Of this 15-day total, about $34.65 million, or 8.42%, derived from transaction fees. Miners earned slightly over $2 billion in March and $1.79 billion in April. However, May’s earnings are unlikely to even come close those levels. Bitcoin’s hashprice, or the daily value of 1 petahash of output, currently stands at $52.36. This is a significant improvement from the low of $46.51 per PH/s on May 9 and also higher than the $48.98 per PH/s noted on May 14 at 9 p.m. EDT. Although BTC’s block rewards have been halved and fees remain minimal, the increasing value of BTC is a positive development for miners invested in the network. The next factors to consider for BTC miners are the future outlook and whether the reduced revenue is sustainable. As noted, the rise in BTC’s price is advantageous, and the most recent difficulty adjustment was also favorable for miners. The adjustment at block height 842,688 on May 9 marked the most significant decrease since December 2022. Statistics as of May 15 indicate the next retarget is expected on or around May 23, with another reduction in the cards. Higher BTC values and another difficulty decrease would greatly benefit miners. The recent trends in bitcoin’s hashrate and miner revenues highlight the delicate balance between computational power and financial returns in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As miners navigate fluctuating hashprices and reward structures, the sustainability of their operations will depend on both technological advancements and market dynamics. The upcoming difficulty adjustments and bitcoin price movements will be crucial in shaping the future landscape for miners.

The 100 MW is anticipated to double the capacity of the hydro-powered Yguazu site and should be fully operational by 2025. Bitfarms (TSX: BITF) has acquired an extra 100 MW of capacity for its hydro-powered Yguazu facility in Paraguay. According to the company, this hydropower will generate low-cost electricity at $0.039 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) without being subject to inflationary increases. Construction at the Yguazu site commenced in March, including the high-voltage interconnection to the ANDE substation. “The additional 100 MW provides a low-cost growth path for the first half of 2025 without impacting our 2024 21 EH/s target which remains on schedule,” Bitfarms’ chief mining officer, Ben Gagnon, remarked on Tuesday. “Growing Yguazu to 200 MW is expected to increase our 2025 megawatts under management by 23% from 428 MW to 528 MW.” Gagnon added: Importantly this expansion takes advantage of our existing construction plan, amortizing development costs over a broader infrastructure base and driving down overall costs per megawatt. Damian Polla, Bitfarms’ General Manager of LATAM, explained that the megawatts were obtained directly through ANDE without any direct acquisition costs. Polla added that Paraguay represents Bitfarms’ most significant growth opportunity, with 270 MW of infrastructure expansion from the new Paso Pe and Yguazu farms.

Following the halving, onchain costs have decreased significantly, with data indicating transfer fees ranging from $1.50 to $3.65 per transaction. According to statistics, the three-day simple moving average (SMA) for Bitcoin’s hashrate, which reveals greater volatility compared to the seven-day SMA, recorded a peak of 685 EH/s on April 24, 2024. The all-time high (ATH) for the seven-day SMA stands at 655 EH/s. Using the 72-hour average, about 135 EH/s has been subtracted from the network. Consequently, in just over two weeks since the ATH, the network experienced a 19.7% decrease in hashrate. Following the recent reward halving, onchain fees have significantly decreased since April 24. On that date, the average onchain fee stood at $28, but it dropped to just 0.00006 BTC or $3.65 per transaction 16 days later. Current data from mempool.space indicates that fees range from $1.50 to $1.96 for low to high-priority transactions, respectively. Despite these reductions, over 216,000 transactions in the mempool are still pending confirmation. This ongoing congestion stems from continued strong activity across financial transfers, Ordinal inscriptions, and Runes protocol engagements. Although a record high of over 927,000 transactions was confirmed on April 23, the daily transaction confirmation rate has since adjusted to between 400,000 and 700,000. While the number of daily confirmed transactions remains high, the fees are considerably lower, as all three types of users are opting to pay fewer satoshis per virtual byte (sats/vB) on the Bitcoin network. At the same time, bitcoin miners are contending with fluctuations in BTC’s market value, which has been struggling to maintain a position above the $60,000 mark per unit, falling by 3% this week. Coupled with reduced fees and lower rewards, the hashprice, or cost per petahash per second (PH/s) per day, has declined to around $48. As the hashprice continues to drop, profitability diminishes, which has been a significant factor in reducing the overall hashpower. With a continued downtrend in profits and fluctuating market values, additional reductions in the network’s computational strength may loom on the horizon. This may result in additional shifts in the dynamics of mining profitability and difficulty.

The data center facility, in the Bajo del Toro thermoelectric plant, will host 1,200 bitcoin miners. Bitcoin mining companies are increasingly searching for more environment-friendly energy sources to power their operations. Genesis Digital Assets, a bitcoin mining company, has announced that it has partnered with YPF Luz, a power provider, to build a bitcoin mining site run completely using electricity generated from flare gas in Argentina. The Bajo del Toro plant, a recently built thermoelectric facility, will provide energy to Genesis Digital Assets’ bitcoin mining data center, hosting 1,200 miners in a site inside the plant. Before, YPF Luz had prepared a pilot to evaluate the feasibility of this agreement. Bajo del Toro generates its 8-megawatt capacity using flare gas, generated as a byproduct of oil exploration, and is rarely taken advantage of. This is because these oil facilities are rarely near processing centers and it is often economically non-feasible to build the infrastructure needed to transport it. Using this gas, which would be otherwise discarded, is an advancement for both companies, monetizing it and reducing emissions with this partnership. Martin Mandarano, YPF Luz CEO, remarked that this project allowed the company to “reduce the carbon footprint of its exploration activities” through “an adaptable and sustainable flare gas use solution.” Abdumalik Mirakhmedov, founder of Genesis Digital Assets, commented that Argentina was a relevant country for bitcoin mining, given its abundant energy sources and favorable business environment.

Hut 8 primarily attributes the decrease in the number of mined bitcoins to the relocation of its proprietary miners, which were previously hosted at the Kearney and Granbury sites. Hut 8, one of North America’s largest bitcoin miners, recently disclosed that its proprietary production for April fell by 36% to 148 bitcoins (BTC). The miner’s output for April suggests a realized hashrate of 3.44 EH/s, which is 51% lower than the 6.27 EH/s achieved in December following Hut 8’s merger with USBTC. A report in The Miner Mag attributes the drop in Hut 8’s output primarily to the relocation of proprietary miners previously hosted at the Kearney and Granbury sites. Rival miner Marathon purchased these sites from Generate Capital for $178.6 million in late December 2023. Earlier this year, Marathon reportedly paid Hut 8 a termination fee of $13.5 million to end the latter’s tenancy contract. The report also cited the recent BTC halving, which resulted in a 6% to 12% decline in key miners’ respective outputs, as one of the reasons for the drop in the number of bitcoins mined by Hut 8 in April. In remarks accompanying Hut 8’s operations update for April 2024, CEO Asher Genoot announced that the Bitcoin miner has completed the relocation process and has even added new mining capacity. “Amidst the backdrop of the halving, the operational capabilities of our team enabled us to maximize deployed hashrate as we completed the relocation of our fleet from hosted to owned facilities and brought new capacity online,” the Hut 8 CEO said. Genoot stated that in just over three months, Hut 8 had energized 63 megawatts, totaling nearly 18,000 miners. As a result, the current self-mining hashrate is at 5.5 exahash per second (EH/s), he said. The CEO also disclosed that the Bitcoin miner had partially energized a site in Ward County, Texas, which has a capacity of 215 megawatts. What are your thoughts on this story?

During this period, the network’s hashprice dropped from over $100 per petahash to below $45 at the beginning of May. It has since increased to $50 per petahash. Despite the modest rebound, the network’s total hashrate has experienced a decrease, with a reduction of about 50 exahash since the halving event. This weekend, Bitcoin’s total hashrate is maintaining levels around 600 exahash per second (EH/s), occasionally fluctuating slightly below and above this mark. This decline follows the all-time high in hashrate that occurred just before the fourth reward halving on April 19, 2024, when it peaked at 655 EH/s. Since that milestone, approximately 50 EH/s have gradually diminished. This decrease in hashrate corresponds with the value of hashing power reaching lows not observed in several years. On May 5, 1 petahash per second (PH/s) of hashpower per day is $50. The downturn in hashprice began about two weeks ago, while the noticeable decline in the hashrate commenced around seven days ago on April 27. Over the last 2,016 blocks, the network has averaged roughly 622.5 EH/s. The decline in hashrate has led to lengthier block intervals, which could result in a difficulty reduction on May 8, 2024. Projections suggest a potential 3.4% decrease in difficulty at the next retarget. Following the halving, the block subsidy decreased from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Since then, the average fees per block have been around .90 BTC to 1.01 BTC. Should the price fail to increase, we might witness further reductions in the hashrate. Conversely, BTC miners have mitigated some risks by updating their equipment to more efficient models. Enhanced joules per terahash and elevated revenues during March and April may provide a substantial financial cushion for these operators. Looking ahead, the potential difficulty reduction could help recalibrate operations, influencing miner profitability in this new subsidy era.

The revenue increase was slight, rising from $73.2 million to $79.3 million. Remarkably, this was achieved even as Riot Platforms experienced a 36% decrease in the number of bitcoins mined, down to 1,364. In the first quarter of 2024, the integrated bitcoin mining firm, Riot Platforms Inc., saw its revenues exceed $79.3 million. This total quarterly revenue is an increase of just over $6 million from the $73.2 million generated in the corresponding quarter of 2023. According to a statement, Riot Platforms managed to achieve this modest revenue growth despite producing fewer bitcoins. According to a statement, Riot Platforms produced only 1,364 bitcoins during the quarter under review, compared to the 2,115 bitcoins mined in the same period the previous year. However, a 131% increase in the price of BTC more than compensated for the 36% drop in bitcoins mined. The bitcoin miner meanwhile attributed the reduced production to a “significant increase in the Bitcoin network difficulty,” the statement said. During the period under review, Riot Platforms’ average cost to mine one BTC was $23,034, which is over $13,500 more than the Q1 2023 average cost of $9,438. Riot Platforms also earned $5.1 million in power curtailment credits, compared to the $3.1 million earned in Q1 of 2023. Data shows that Riot Platform’s myself-mining capacity segment accounted for 94%, or $74.6 million, of total revenues, while the engineering segment accounted for the remainder, or $4.7 million. In 2023, the engineering segment recorded $16.7 million, while the mining segment had $48 million. Commenting on the impressive performance of the BTC miner in the quarter, Riot CEO Jason Les said: This quarter, Riot reported net income of $211.8 million and earnings per share of $0.82 which are new record highs for our quarterly results. Additionally, we reported $245.7 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, another record high for Riot, rounding out strong financial performance for the quarter. Meanwhile, Les also revealed that the recently deployed miners at Riot Platforms’ Corsicana Facility are already hashing. The bitcoin miner is on track to increase its self-mining hash rate capacity to 31 EH/s by year’s end. Overall, Riot Platforms anticipates three pending orders will add an estimated 28 EH/s to its self-mining capacity. Therefore, once fully deployed, the new miners from Riot Platforms are expected to push its total self-mining hash rate capacity to 41 EH/s.}\", metadata={'source': '646134', 'row': 419, 'date': '2024-05-03 07:23:43', 'categories': 'Mining'}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"id: 645957\\ncontent: { 'news_date:'2024-05-01 15:47:28, 'news_cateogry: Mining 'news_content': In April, bitcoin miners amassed the second-highest monthly revenue of the past year, following the unprecedented earnings in March.

This development follows the network’s fourth halving and occurs amid a period when Bitcoin’s hashprice has significantly declined, exerting intense pressure on BTC mining operations. Iris Energy Limited (Nasdaq: IREN) recently disclosed that it has elevated its total hashrate to 9 exahash per second (EH/s). The company anticipates achieving 10 EH/s by May and projects an expansion to 20 EH/s by year’s end. Additionally, Iris is poised to enhance its fleet’s nameplate efficiency to 21.9 joules per terahash (J/T). Iris, along with several other publicly listed mining firms, has been acquiring new mining machines from producers of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining rigs, which now feature devices with significantly lower J/T efficiency than earlier models. In October 2023, Iris invested $19.6 million in S21 Bitmain brand Antminers and added 7,000 T21 Antminers in November. The following month, the company secured an additional 8,380 T21 Antminers. Currently, miners are navigating challenging times, as they previously earned over $100 per petahash per second (PH/s) per day before reaching block height 840,000, commonly referred to as the halving. As of now, the hashprice, or the anticipated value of 1 PH/s per day, has dropped to $48.62 per petahash. To mitigate some of their losses, mining companies such as Iris have branched out to provide artificial intelligence (AI) computing data alongside their mining operations. Iris also revealed plans to increase its capacity by an additional 50 megawatts (MW) upon completing Childress Phase 3 within this year. This expansion will boost the firm’s data center capacity from 460 MW to 510 MW by the end of 2024.

Mining bitcoin (BTC) has become significantly challenging, with the network’s difficulty reaching an all-time high of 88.10 trillion. This complexity, coupled with powerful mining pools that dominate the scene, has left solo miners with modest and older equipment struggling to compete. Most miners with even a few application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners typically join pools to enhance their chances of earning block rewards, which are then shared among participants. Nevertheless, some miners still opt to go it alone, or join pools designed to let them keep a substantial share of the rewards if their work was instrumental in discovering a block. One such pool is Solo Ckpool, which incentivizes individual efforts. Remarkably, on April 28, 2024, an administrator of this pool announced that a fortunate solo miner successfully mined block 841,286, marking a notable achievement in the post-halving era. “Congratulations to miner 365ughTgK9Q7rXXTM7vubqy1awZ2AZJijP for solving the 282nd solo block solved at [Solo Ckpool] with a large ~120PH at the time (12PH average over a week),” the Ckpool dev posted on X. “From the block solve summary, one can postulate that this large miner either recently switched from pooled mining post-halving (presumably for no longer recouping their elec. costs) for a chance at a solo block, or has been intermittently hashing/renting large amounts solo,” the Ckpool developer added. The news arrives as the hashprice, or the expected value of one petahash per second (PH/s) of hashing power per day, has dipped below $50 per petahash. At 8 a.m. EDT on April 28, 2024, the network’s hashprice was recorded at $49.62 per petahash. There has been a decrease in overall hashrate, evident from the three-day simple moving average (SMA), which shows a drop to 605 exahash per second (EH/s) from a peak of 655 EH/s observed just three days prior. With the hashrate declining and block intervals exceeding the usual ten-minute mark, the anticipated difficulty adjustment set for May 8, 2024, is expected to see a reduction. In the high-stakes arena of bitcoin mining, where the network’s difficulty coasts along at unprecedented levels, the discovery of a block by a solo miner becomes an unfathomable event. The solo miner’s success story underscores the element of chance still present in the mining landscape, particularly for those opting to go it alone.

Over the last 100 blocks, bitcoin miners averaged about 3.55 BTC for each block they mined, indicating that bitcoin miners are receiving less than half a BTC per block in onchain fees. Bitcoin miners are currently earning significantly less BTC than before the halving event, and the high fees they previously enjoyed after block height 840,000 have been erased. These initial high fees may have provided some miners with enough financial buffer to withstand the current downturn in revenue. However, those who did not benefit from these fees might face tougher challenges ahead. As of April 28 at 5 a.m. Eastern Time, Bitcoin’s hashprice, or the expected value of 1 PH/s of hashing power per day, was approximately $51.66 per petahash. Before the halving event, which reduced BTC’s block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, miners were earning over $100 per petahash per day. Regardless of perspective, miners have experienced a significant drop in revenue, akin to a drastic 50% off clearance sale.

On April 25, Luxor Technologies reported a significant decline in the prices of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bitcoin mining rigs, highlighting that two specific models experienced price reductions ranging from 28% to 35%. Over the past week, Bitcoin.com News has reported the hashprice, essentially the projected earnings from 1 terahash per second (TH/s) or 1 petahash per second (PH/s) per day. Simply put, the hashprice represents the daily earnings an ASIC mining rig might anticipate for each terahash of computing power they deploy on the Bitcoin network. It acts as a daily earnings rate for the computational efforts of these devices. At current hashprice values, data indicates that a total of eight proof-of-work (PoW) crypto assets currently yield higher mining profits than those using the SHA256 consensus algorithm. The list includes algorithms like Kheavyhash, Blake3, Scrypt, Eaglesong, Ethash, Randomx, Cuckatoo32, and Blake2B-Sia. The leading models in today’s market feature recently launched bitcoin (BTC) mining rigs such as Bitmain’s S21, S21 Pro air-cooled units, and the S21 hydro unit. Moreover, Microbt’s M63S, M66S, and M60S models rank among the top five bitcoin miners for daily earnings as of April 26, 2024. Specifications reveal that Auradine’s AT2880 air-cooled and the AI3680 – immersion single-phase units also remain profitable with the current hashprice value. These, along with Bitmain’s T21 and Microbt’s M60, manage to secure a substantial profit at an electricity cost of $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Profitability calculators show that a much older model, like the Antminer S9 with 14 TH/s and an electricity cost of $0.04 per kWh, would operate at a loss, with daily deficits reaching $2.53. Certainly, publicly listed mining companies and large self-hosted and hosted fleets benefit from more recent machines and reduced operational expenditures (OPEX).  In contrast to the aforementioned newer ASICs produced by Bitmain and Microbt, older models are currently available at discounted prices, as noted by Luxor Technologies. Luxor Technologies specifically pointed out that since September 2023, the prices for Bitmain Antminer S19j Pro models and Microbt M30S+ have decreased by 28% and 35%, respectively. As the bitcoin mining landscape evolves, the shift in profitability will continue to favor newer ASIC models over their predecessors. With advanced technology offering improved efficiency and higher hashrate, these units have become critical in maintaining competitive earnings. While some previously anticipated a significant decline in exahash per second (EH/s) from the network, the latest data collected at 7:10 p.m. EDT by hashrateindex.com shows that the hashrate remains exceptionally high at 640 EH/s. The lower hash price, at least for the moment, has not triggered a significant departure of hashrate from the Bitcoin network.

Just five days ago, miners were harvesting an average of 5.105 BTC per block, between a blend of new BTC and transaction fees, following a peak in the hashprice. However, the average yield per block reward over the past 100 blocks has notably decreased by 24.97% since last Sunday.

On April 23, a record-breaking 927,010 transactions were verified by bitcoin miners within a single day. During this record-setting day, transfers related to the Runes protocol accounted for over 81% of all processed transactions. From more than 11,000 Runes-centric coins, miners have amassed 2,129 BTC in transaction fees. However, the willingness of Runes-based token holders to pay high fees has waned since Apr. 19, with the average transaction fee now reduced to 32 satoshis per virtual byte (sats/vB) for a high-priority transfer. This marks a significant reduction from the 91.4 sats/vB or $12.98 per transaction paid on April 25. Five days prior to this, starting from block height 840,179, miners pulled in an average revenue of 5.105 BTC, following the high earnings post-halving. Between block heights 840,179 and 840,417, miners earned an average of 4.95 BTC from both subsidies and fees.

Currently, miners are earning slightly less per petahash compared to before the halving, when rates were coasting along between $100 and $110 per PH/s. Moreover, with the latest retarget, the task of discovering a block has now become more challenging than ever before. The increasing trend in mining difficulty underscores the strength of Bitcoin’s network security while presenting significant challenges for miners. As computational requirements escalate, miners are compelled to enhance their equipment to maintain competitiveness. This ongoing change significantly affects Bitcoin’s mining landscape, with potential repercussions for miner profitability and participation rates in the network as trends progress.

The post revealed enhancements in the chip design, upgrading from the initially planned 5-nanometer (nm) process to an advanced 3nm architecture. Block intends to construct a mining rig, as detailed in the company’s recent blog post and a social media update from Jack Dorsey. Naoise Irwin, Block’s lead for mining hardware products, revealed that earlier reports from the mining development team mentioned work on a 5nm prototype. However, the design has now advanced to a 3nm process, and the company is proceeding with a full tapeout. During the tapeout phase, every aspect of the chip’s design reaches completion, encompassing circuit design, physical layout, and verification processes. Irwin asserts that its chip will possess substantial performance “required for mining operators of all types to survive and thrive in the fifth mining epoch and beyond.” Block’s foray into the production of application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) occurs amid intense competition. For example, Microbt, Bitmain, and Canaan have launched new mining rigs that feature enhanced hashrates and improved efficiency levels. Bitdeer has also entered the ASIC market by unveiling the Sealminer A1 mining rigs and announcing its collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for the fabrication process. The Sealminer’s semiconductor is based on 4nm technology. The manufacturer Auradine also creates its own ASIC, utilizing 4nm silicon chip technology. Irwin contends that with an independent mining chip, Block will be the sole large, well-funded mining hardware vendor offering such a solution. The company’s blog post emphasized its hope that this will foster innovation in mining systems and aid in the development of new mining system form factors and use cases. The product lead concluded that the firm remains eager to receive feedback from mining participants to collect additional input. What do you think about Block revealing its 3nm chip production?

This research-backed initiative encourages miners to utilize low-carbon energy sources by offering financial incentives. The rise of the Bitcoin network has brought with it concerns over the environmental impact of mining, especially the carbon emissions from the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) process. Paypal‘s Blockchain Research Group, insisting there is an urgency with the issue, has partnered with Energy Web and DMG to develop a system that rewards miners who use green energy. This initiative aims to shift the industry towards more sustainable energy sources by making green mining financially attractive. “We present a solution to this issue by incentivizing miners that use low carbon energy sources,” the paper’s authors detail. “The proposal rewards miners with bitcoins in a trust- independent manner (i.e., without having to trust a third party to earn the reward) when they verifiably use a significant portion of low carbon energy sources in their mining operations.”  Bitcoin miners using verified low-carbon energy sources are identified as “green miners” and are rewarded with bitcoin (BTC). These rewards are structured through a novel crypto-economic model involving a multi-sig (multi-signature) payout address. Transactions are preferentially routed to green miners, who can then claim their rewards by mining these transactions. The researchers believe the approach not only incentivizes cleaner mining practices, but also increases the flow of transactions towards these environmentally friendly miners. The green mining protocol involves several technical components, including the identification of green miners through Energy Web’s validation platform and the use of public keys associated with green energy usage. These keys help in managing and distributing incentives, ensuring that only eligible miners can access the rewards. The system also involves broadcasting transactions with low fees to discourage non-green miners from processing them, further ensuring that incentives go specifically to green miners. “When a green miner receives the transaction in the mempool, they identify it as being a green transaction based on the multi-sig payout address,” the paper details. “The miner will need to include the transaction while assembling a block and include an additional redeem transaction within the same block to consume UTXO that locked bitcoins in the payout address.” Paypal’s Blockchain Research Group adds: This additional transaction will have a recipient address belonging to the green miner. As a result, only the green miner who includes the green transaction, redeem transaction and successfully mines the next block is assured of earning the bitcoin reward. By utilizing blockchain technology and crypto-economic rewards, the backers of the research paper aspire to foster a transition to renewable energy within the mining sector. Whether this will be achieved remains to be seen, as this paper from the payments giant presents only a hypothetical scenario that has yet to be tested in real-world conditions among industry miners.

To date, the network’s hashrate has experienced a modest decline, though nothing too substantial yet, following the completion of the fourth reward halving. Bitcoin miners now receive lower U.S. dollar revenue for their mined output compared to the first week before the halving. Data from Luxor’s hashrateindex.com show that the hashprice, or the expected value of 1 petahash per second (PH/s) of hashing power per day, maintained above $105 per PH/s on average, the week before block 840,000. On April 15, four days before the reward halving, the hashprice stood at $108 per PH/s. During a period of historically high fees, the hashprice reached $182 per petahash on April 20. However, by the end of the next day, it had fallen to $114. Since that time, it has further declined to just above $79 per petahash, marking a 30% decrease in value. On Sunday, miners were earning an average of 5.105 BTC per block reward, which has since decreased. Between block heights 840,179 and 840,417, spanning 239 BTC blocks, miners garnered an average of 4.95 BTC from both subsidy and fees collected during that period. This indicates that, on average, between blocks 840,179 and 840,417, the average sum of fees per block amounted to approximately 1.82 BTC. On the day of the halving, Bitcoin’s hashrate peaked at an all-time high of 655 exahash per second (EH/s). However, it has since decreased to 631 EH/s by April 23 at 6 a.m. EDT. As the dust settles following Bitcoin’s fourth halving, the implications for miners and the broader ecosystem are becoming clearer. Despite a drop in hashprice and a slight dip in hashrate, Bitcoin’s network resilience remains unshaken. The reduction in block rewards has initiated a critical test of efficiency and sustainability for miners.

On Friday, the fees peaked at $240 per transaction, but by now they have fallen to just $11.06 each. Since reaching block height 840,179, miners are now earning less bitcoin in rewards compared to before the halving event at block 840,000. Initially, following the halving, the average onchain fee soared to over $240 per transaction around 9 p.m. EDT on Friday. As of 8 a.m. EDT on Sunday, the cost for a high-priority transaction has settled at 121 satoshis per virtual byte (sat/vB) or $11 per transfer. Concurrently, bitcoin’s trading price stands at $65,300 per unit at 8 a.m. EDT as well. In the early stages after block 840,000, bitcoin miners secured nine of the ten highest fees ever recorded on BTC blocks. They accumulated an impressive 1,087.99 bitcoins in fees alone during the first 93 blocks post-halving. However, by 8 a.m. on Sunday, this high-earning trend appeared to have halted. Post block 840,179, the reward in BTC for miners has diminished. Bitcoin’s hashprice, the value of 1 petahash per second (PH/s) of daily hashrate, has dropped sharply from $183 per PH/s on April 20 to $114 per PH/s as of 7 a.m. EDT on Sunday, April 21. Before the halving, block rewards included 6.25 BTC plus transaction fees, averaging about 6.776 BTC between block heights 839,848 to 839,900. Now, the average has dropped to approximately 5.105 BTC per block after the decrease in fees or since block height 840,179. Bitcoin miners enjoyed a short-lived advantage where, for nearly two days, block rewards yielded much higher returns than before the halving. Miners fortunate enough to operate between blocks 840,000 and 840,179 reaped an average of 12.867 BTC per block.

Mining companies now seek to extract extra value from their operations using Ordinals. Foundry, a New York-based digital mining and staking company, reported that if it produces the Bitcoin halving block, it will try to monetize its first satoshi due to its market value derived from the Ordinals protocol. In a communication sent to members of its Foundry USA mining pool, the company acknowledged it was aware of the value that market speculation could give to the first satoshi in the halving block, the “epic satoshi.” Ordinals, a protocol developed by Casey Rodarmor, imbues each satoshi with numismatic value, allowing interested users to collect them. This is why this satoshi would have a special value for an Ordinals collector. Foundry stated that it is prepared to isolate this satoshi and make “reasonable efforts” to monetize it and share the proceeds with pool members. The distribution would be made depending on the hashrate of each user in the Foundry’s pool during the day of the Bitcoin halving.

As of 8:50 a.m. EDT on April 19, 2024, the hashrate soared to a record 653 exahash per second (EH/s). Just hours ahead of Bitcoin’s fourth halving, the network’s hashrate has set a new peak, reaching 653 EH/s on Friday—a 12 EH/s increase over the highest record set a week earlier. BTC miners are vigorously pursuing block height 840,000 to collect as many 6.25 BTC rewards as possible before they halve to 3.125 BTC. Despite a spike in mining difficulty last week coupled with a notable price decline, the hashrate has persistently risen. Observers note that at its current growth rate, the hashrate might propel Bitcoin into the zettahash era within this cycle. One zettahash per second (ZH/s), or one quintillion kilohash per second (KH/s), is equivalent to 1,000 EH/s. As of Jan. 1, 2024, the total network hashrate stood at about 512 EH/s, having climbed by 141 EH/s over recent months. In just the last three days, 438 blocks have been mined, with Foundry USA securing 126 of them. Currently, Foundry holds a total hashrate of 187.59 EH/s, up from 140.26 EH/s in January—gaining an impressive 47.33 EH/s in the past 96 days.

This revelation follows earlier findings that highlighted a notable concentration of custodianship among the same pools. 0xB10C’s latest analysis on the social media platform X reveals that mining pools such as Btc.com, Binance Pool, and Poolin share the same mining template and custom transaction prioritization as Antpool. This uniformity could suggest a deeper collaboration or standardization in mining operations across these platforms, potentially affecting the decentralization ethos of Bitcoin. According to 0xB10C, the similarity in templates extends to the way transactions are selected and ordered within the blocks. For instance, while many pools typically prioritize transactions with higher fees, the pools in question have been observed using a fixed transaction paying significantly lower fees. This practice could influence the overall transaction processing dynamics of the network. Particularly when a significant amount of hashrate is working together. This discovery was built upon earlier findings by Mononaut, a developer from mempool.space, who reported that a single custodian now controls the coinbase addresses for several pools, accounting for 47% of Bitcoin’s hashrate. These pools include major players like F2pool, Antpool, Binance Pool, and Braiins, adding another layer of concern regarding the centralization of mining power. The developer observed that although F2pool uses the same custody provider, the evidence suggests that they do not utilize Antpool’s templates. “We know from multiple occasions that F2pool has been building their own templates,” stated 0xB10C. As an onchain analyst, 0xB10C was the first to identify specific bitcoin transactions linked to addresses sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury that were absent from F2pool’s blocks back in November 2023. The implications of such centralization are significant, prompting discussions within the community about the potential risks to the network’s security and integrity. “When pools are just acting as proxies for other pools without being upfront about it, bitcoiners need to take note. The time to demand Stratum V2 is now,” Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo remarked on X while sharing 0xB10C’s X thread. Stratum V2 could theoretically enhance transparency and decentralization by allowing individual miners to choose their own block templates rather than relying on those dictated by pool operators. This protocol upgrade would not only reduce the influence of large mining pools over the network but also empower contributing miners. However, a 2022 report from Galaxy indicates a divide between application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) manufacturers and developers regarding the implementation of Stratum V2.

The CEOs of bitcoin mining firms reportedly remain bullish despite the anticipated drop in block rewards, which is set to follow the top cryptocurrency asset’s halving on or around April 20. Many of the CEOs believe a combination of low-cost operations and more efficient equipment will enable miners to offset the revenue loss related to the halving. According to a report, Bitcoin’s fourth halving since its launch will result in miners losing as much as $10 billion in revenues. Additionally, the halving hype has not translated into increased investor interest in the stock of mining companies. To support this assertion, the report highlights the retreat in bitcoin miners’ shares just a few days before the halving. The 28% drop in Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners’ exchange-traded fund also supports the same view. Despite the dampened investor sentiment, the CEOs of the mining companies surveyed by Bloomberg are positive about the future.

Despite a recent uptick in mining difficulty, miners have managed to maintain a high hashrate, resulting in block times dropping below the average ten-minute mark. As of this writing, only 519 blocks remain until the Bitcoin halving, anticipated this week at block 840,000. The forecasts now point to the event unfolding on April 19, deviating from the initial April 20 estimate. Some BTC advocates had expressed a preference for the halving to align with the culturally significant 4-20 date, known for its associations with cannabis culture. Several online counters indicate an April 20 date, relying on the ten-minute average for block intervals. However, these intervals can vary, often being faster or slower than the estimated ten minutes. For example, the current pace of block generation averages about 9 minutes and 23 seconds. Recently, the hashrate hit a record high of 644 exahash per second (EH/s), as reported by the seven-day average from Luxor’s hashrateindex.com. Currently, the hashrate is steady at 634 EH/s, indicating that it remains high as miners continue to apply significant hashpower to discover block rewards of 6.25 BTC. Naturally, the competition is fierce, and each mining pool is quite eager to be the one to discover block 840,000. The three mining pools that discovered the blocks during the 2012, 2016, and 2020 halvings continue their operations today. Onchain metrics reveal that Slushpool, now known as Braiins Pool, uncovered block 210,000, reducing the reward from 50 to 25 BTC per block. A miner identified as “laughingbear” played a role in locating this block, which was mined using a Radeon HD 5800 graphics processing unit (GPU). The GPU that mined block 210,000 fetched a significant premium when sold in 2013. On Nov. 28, 2012, the total hashrate was approximately 28 terahash per second (TH/s), with BTC trading at about $12 per coin. The halving on July 9, 2016, led to the discovery of block 420,000 by F2pool, marking a decrease in block rewards from 25 to 12.5 BTC. At that time, the hashrate stood at 1.5 exahash per second (EH/s) and BTC was trading at $650 per unit. Antpool was responsible for finding block 630,000 on May 11, 2020, which brought the block reward down from 12.5 BTC to the current 6.25. On May 11, 2020, the hashrate hovered just above 100 exahash per second (EH/s), with BTC valued at roughly $8,600 per coin. By around April 19, 2024, miners are anticipated to receive 3.125 BTC per block, plus the transaction fees from the approved transactions within that block. The price has not only climbed significantly from one halving to the next, but the hashrate has also experienced substantial increases over the same period.

The performance of these mining stocks has declined compared to their stronger start earlier this year, coinciding with the proximity of just 663 blocks remaining until the next reward halving. Marathon Digital (Nasdaq: MARA), a prominent publicly-listed bitcoin mining company, has seen its share value diminish by over 17% in the last five days, with a total drop of 19.7% over the past month. Similarly, Cleanspark (Nasdaq: CLSK) experienced an 11.7% decline during the same five-day period and a 9.7% decrease over the month. Like these, most mining stocks have underperformed recently, with the upcoming reward halving just about five days away. The recent decline in price has decreased the hashprice, or the anticipated daily value of 1 petahash per second (PH/s) of hashing power, to $100 after falling from $119 just three days ago. Should the hashprice stay at this level, the impending reward halving will significantly tighten miners’ revenue. A further drop in price could exacerbate the situation. The prospect of financial difficulties for mining firms has spurred short positions against 15 publicly listed mining companies. Bloomberg disclosed on Sunday that as of April 8, 2024, the short interest in these mining firms is approaching $2 billion, with a substantial $867.4 million of that focused on Marathon Digital (MARA). Short sellers also heavily target Cleanspark (CLSK) and Riot Platforms (RIOT). In anticipation of Bitcoin’s fourth reward halving, at least a dozen of these companies have invested significantly in acquiring tens of thousands of new mining machines and expanding their facilities. Furthermore, no one’s projections factored in geopolitical tensions as the halving approaches. As Bitcoin’s fourth reward halving draws near, the landscape appears challenging for miners. Recent price drops from highs signal tougher times ahead, especially for smaller operators and those using outdated equipment. Even large publicly-listed mining firms are feeling the pressure, with significant declines in stock values. Short sellers are wagering that these trends will continue, betting heavily against the sector’s stability.

Should the prices remain low leading up to the forthcoming halving event scheduled for next week, certain mining devices may only be viable if they operate on free or nearly free energy. In just one week, bitcoin (BTC) miners are set to encounter their fourth halving event, which will halve their block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC at block height 840,000. This Friday saw a notable decline in bitcoin’s price, dropping 5% in value, subsequently impacting mining revenues. As a result, bitcoin’s hashprice, the anticipated daily earnings from a certain percentage of hashing power, has dipped to $116 per PH/s. When broken down to 1 terahash per second (TH/s) per day, a single terahash’s worth amounts to $0.116. While hashprice offers a glimpse into potential mining profits, other factors such as electricity costs play a crucial role. For example, even with electricity priced at $0.12 per kilowatt hour (kWh), the latest mining machines like Microbt’s Whatsminer M63S, Bitmain’s S21 in both hydro and air-cooled variants, and Microbt’s latest air-cooled units, still manage to yield a decent profit at today’s BTC exchange rates. However, the cost of acquiring these advanced machines is steep unless you’re a major miner purchasing in bulk. Many home and solo miners continue to use older models like Bitmain’s vintage Antminer S9, which offers 13.5 TH/s of hashrate. With sufficiently low electricity rates, such as $0.01 per kWh, even an S9 can be profitable. However, once the halving takes effect and if prices remain stable or fall, sustaining profits with an S9 beyond block 840,000 could become quite challenging. As an example, a used S9 including a power supply can be purchased for $120 on Ebay or secondary markets, potentially generating $0.74 daily after 136 days to recuperate the initial cost, assuming electricity remains at $0.01 per kWh. Consequently, over the past year, it hasn’t been the home or solo miners, but rather large-scale mining operations that have invested billions in the most recent equipment from manufacturers like Canaan, Microbt, Bitmain, and Auradine. The next-generation rigs produced by these companies offer higher hashrate outputs and enhanced efficiency in terms of joules per terahash (J/T). Utilizing these advanced rigs generally results in luckier outcomes, higher odds in mining, and more SHA256 hashrate for securing BTC block rewards. Recent reports highlight that U.S.-based bitcoin mining operators are upgrading to newer application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) rigs while offloading older models or relocating them to regions where electricity costs are significantly lower than in the United States. As the bitcoin mining landscape shifts towards more efficient technologies, the impending halving will test the resilience and adaptability of miners. With escalating equipment costs and fluctuating market prices, only operations with access to cheap energy and the latest technology will thrive.

The analysis shows that substantial miners’ rewards from pools like F2pool, Antpool, Binance Pool, and Braiins are being funneled to this particular custodian. Earlier this week, a developer at mempool.space, known as Mononaut, disclosed data regarding a substantial quantity of coinbase rewards being directed to a single custodian. “A single custodian now controls the coinbase addresses of at least 9 pools, representing 47% of total hashrate,” Mononaut stated on X. The data illustrates the consolidation of mining reward outputs from F2pool, Antpool, Binance Pool, Braiins, Btc.com, Poolin, and Secpool. Mononaut further mentioned that the custodian handles rewards from Ultimuspool and 1Thash as well. The developer observed that previously, the entity received rewards from Luxor, but when Mononaut published details on the matter last year, Luxor apparently “changed their setup.” The developer explained that the pools collaborate, contributing hashrate to Antpool’s and Viabtc’s accelerator platforms. The mempool.space engineer added: \\u200b\\u200bIn other words, this one entity holds the keys to at least 47 out of every 100 freshly mined bitcoins. This development was met with disapproval by several members of the cryptocurrency community. Crypto advocate and critic Chris Blec commented on X, stating, “this is really bad.” He further asserted, “These pools are going to destroy Bitcoin decentralization.” In the past Blec, among others, has expressed concerns over the substantial hashrate controlled by some leading pools. According to Btc.com metrics, Foundry USA holds 26.45% while Antpool possesses 24.36%. Consequently, of the 431 blocks mined over three days, Foundry uncovered 114 and Antpool discovered 105 blocks. Out of the 2,693.75 BTC rewarded to all the miners in 72 hours, both pools captured a total of 1368.75 freshly minted BTC. The community’s primary concern revolves around any potential censorship of transactions by a concentrated mining group. Additionally, several pools have either been suspected of or caught filtering transactions. Following the release of the X thread, Mononaut returned to disclose that the custodian in question is reportedly Cobo. “The custodian is Cobo (institutional custody and settlement provider),” Mononaut commented. On Cobo’s website, a dropdown menu lists “customers,” with links leading to specific pages such as “exchanges.” Notably, there is a section marked “mining pools,” which, unlike the exchange section, remains inaccessible.

Recent data from theminermag.com’s Miner Weekly on Thursday shows that bitcoin miners are conserving their reserves as the event draws close. A new weekly mining report from theminermag.com reveals that publicly listed mining companies are maintaining firm control over their bitcoin (BTC) holdings. It points out that it is “interesting to see that their combined bitcoin reserves are finally back to the level before the June 2022 sell-off.” According to the report, as of March 31, these companies possessed more than 46,200 BTC. It also observes that the peak figure for this statistic was 48,000 BTC, which was reached in April 2022. Currently, at block height 838,867, there are 1,133 blocks remaining until the halving event, where bitcoin mining rewards will be reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC at block 840,000. Recently, after a decline in the hashprice, or the daily revenue per petahash per second (PH/s), in the first week of April, the hashprice has begun to climb, reaching over $119 per PH/s by April 12. During this period of increasing prices, miners have faced a 3.92% increase in mining difficulty. Simultaneously, Bitcoin’s hashrate has soared to a record peak of 644 exahash per second (EH/s).  Analysis from theminermag.com points out that Marathon, Hut8, and Riot rank as the leading holders among publicly listed miners. In anticipation of the halving, a significant number of BTC miners have been scaling up their operations by investing billions in acquiring tens of thousands of new, more efficient mining rigs and enhancing the output capacity of their facilities to generate additional megawatts. The crunch is likely to impact smaller entities and individual miners who rely on older machines with reduced terahash per second (TH/s) output and lesser efficiency compared to the latest models. For example, despite the price increase, older machines have continued to operate; however, when the halving occurs, these older rigs may no longer be profitable beyond block 840,000. Last month, miners generated a record-breaking revenue of $2.01 billion, including $85.81 million from fees. As of April, miners have accumulated revenues of $749.25 million, with $31.34 million derived from transaction fees. As the halving approaches, the landscape of bitcoin mining is poised for significant change. With heightened competition and increasing operational demands, the pressure on smaller mining operations could intensify.

The firm initially secured the option last year, and the agreement has now been enhanced to include the latest S21 Pro model from Bitmain, which offers 15 joules per terahash (J/T). On Friday, Cleanspark (Nasdaq: CLSK) disclosed that its operations have surpassed a total hashrate of 17 exahash per second (EH/s). Back in January 2024, the company announced the acquisition of 60,000 application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bitcoin mining rigs and mentioned its right to purchase an additional 100,000 S21 Antminers at a set price of $16 per terahash. This was prior to the release of the Antminer S21 Pro, known for its enhanced efficiency of 15 J/T. Cleanspark has amended the deal, enabling the purchase of the S21 Pro units at the unchanged price of $16 per terahash, offering a significant improvement in BTC mining efficiency. The total investment for acquiring these 100,000 Antminers is estimated at $374 million. By opting for the S21 Pro, Cleanspark anticipates a 17% increase in hashrate, approximately an additional 3.4 EH/s compared to the former S21 models. “Efficiency is the most important variable as we head into the halving,” Zach Bradford, the CEO of Cleanspark commented on Friday. “With the upgrade to the new S21 Pro, we expect that we have cemented our lead as the most efficient publicly traded bitcoin miner at scale in North America. Our extraordinary scale has allowed us to make meaningful gains in our bitcoin production without having to increase the energy use of our data centers.” Bradford also noted that post-halving, many older and less efficient units will likely be phased out, thus naturally boosting his company’s market share. He pointed out that more efficient machines also reduce the overall energy consumption of the Bitcoin network.

This escalation in difficulty will make it increasingly challenging to mine blocks as the fourth halving event nears, with fewer than 1,250 blocks remaining until block 840,000 is mined. As of April 10, the difficulty of mining a block has intensified by 3.92% following the most recent adjustment. Concurrently, Bitcoin’s network hashrate also attained its highest level ever, as indicated by the seven-day simple moving average (SMA) metrics, which shows a peak of 641 exahash per second (EH/s). This uptick was due to block intervals shortening to less than 9 minutes on April 9, quicker than the typical 10-minute average. Even after the latest difficulty adjustment, block times continue to be swift, with the most recent block being mined in just 9 minutes and 17 seconds. At the current block height of 838,751, roughly 1,249 blocks remain until the halving. The next difficulty retarget is slated for after the halving on April 24, approximately 1,921 blocks away. To date in April, miners have collected $686.87 million from mining activities, with $22.9 million of this total derived from transfer fees. At this moment, an impressive 57 entities are contributing SHA256 hashrate towards the Bitcoin blockchain. Foundry USA and Antpool lead in hashrate contributions, with Foundry delivering 176.74 EH/s and Antpool contributing 150.3 EH/s over the past three days. Consequently, 27.73% of all blocks mined are attributed to Foundry, while Antpool accounts for 23.58%. Viabtc, F2pool, Binance Pool, and SBI Crypto follow in their lead, actively participating in the mining landscape. As the countdown to Bitcoin’s fourth halving ticks closer, the mining landscape is tightly contested, reflected by rising difficulty levels and strong hashrate contributions from top pools. The latest surge underscores the enduring allure and competitive nature of mining BTC, even as participants brace for the implications of the upcoming halving.

However, this reduction may be erased in the next adjustment, which is projected to increase by anywhere from 1.2% to 2.16%. The upcoming difficulty adjustment is anticipated to happen at block height 838,656, providing miners with 1,344 blocks to mine until block 840,000. During this period, between the adjustment and the halving, miners are poised to generate around 8,393.75 newly minted bitcoins through their mining efforts. As of the latest update, bitcoin miners are currently generating approximately 604 exahash per second (EH/s) of SHA256 hashrate. The hashprice, representing the anticipated value of 1 petahash per second (PH/s) per day, stands at roughly $104. This figure is lower than the peak seen in mid-March when the hashprice soared to $120 per PH/s per day on March 13. Since the beginning of April, miners have accumulated a total of $263 million, with $7 million of that sum attributed to collected BTC transaction fees.

The bill alleges that 28% of the energy losses of the National Power Administration (ANDE) correspond, in part, to illegal bitcoin mining connections. Paraguay is shifting its view on cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency mining. A group of Paraguayan lawmakers introduced a bill that seeks to temporarily ban cryptocurrency mining operations in the country due to its intensive use of electric energy. The bill, introduced to the National Congress on April 3, proposes enacting a 180-day ban on the operation and installation of cryptocurrency mining farms and other operations involving cryptocurrency assets. This ban could be extended until a law that regulates these activities is enacted. In the first article, the document details the activities falling under its scope. It states: The creation, conservation, storage and commercialization of virtual assets or crypto assets, cryptocurrencies and the installation of crypto mining farms in Paraguayan territory are temporarily prohibited. Illegal cryptocurrency mining operations have originated significant economic losses for the National Power Administration (ANDE). According to the bill, only in the department of Alto Parana, these operations could cause losses of $60 million in 2024. Lawmakers have also linked recent energy blackouts to illegal cryptocurrency mining operations, which impact the lives of Paraguayans. The suspension of cryptocurrency mining activities would guarantee fair access to power for all Paraguayans, allowing the country to adequate its grid to manage this intensive power draw. The bill argues that suspending this activity until “an adequate power supply can be guaranteed and can handle this additional demand without interruptions in service to other users” is the decision to make. If the bill is passed, legal miners in the country will face an uncertain destiny. Joaquin Morinigo, founder and CEO of crypto consulting company Cryptopy, revealed that formal mining operators had paid the ANDE over $30 million to guarantee the power delivery to 5 unnamed sites. Worried about the outcome, he declared: If the law is approved, what will happen to contracts and guarantees? Does ANDE have the capacity to return the millions of USD in guarantee? What will happen to the employees of mining companies that operate legally? Global bitcoin mining companies like Bitfarms and Pow.re have reported having commenced construction of data centers in Paraguay. If the bill gets passed, these operations could be affected. In March, ANDE, the Supreme Court, and the Department of Justice convened on a joint framework to deal with power theft linked to illegal cryptocurrency mining.

Of this total, $85.81 million was earned from transaction fees over the past month. As we edge closer to the halving event, bitcoin (BTC) miners have seen a significant increase in their earnings, both from collected rewards and transfer fees. March set a new benchmark as the month with the highest revenue in the last year. Moreover, the milestone was also marked as the highest record month for miner income in the network’s lifetime. According to the latest figures, miners raked in $2.01 billion, with $85.81 million of this total coming from transaction fees. The previous peak before March 2024 was observed in May 2021, when earnings hit $1.74 billion. Throughout March, bitcoin mining pools successfully mined 4,412 blocks, with Foundry USA leading the charge by uncovering 1,312 of those blocks. This achievement indicates that Foundry was responsible for approximately 29.74% of the network’s total during the month. Antpool came in second, discovering 989 blocks, which equates to 22.42% of the total blocks mined in March. Hot on the heels of Foundry and Antpool were Viabtc, F2pool, and Binance Pool respectively. As the month draws to a close, data reveals that 54 mining entities actively contribute hashrate to the network. Currently, the Bitcoin network’s hashrate is maintaining a steady pace at 606 exahash per second (EH/s), with a noticeable increase of 20 EH/s over the last month. Bitcoin’s hashprice, which estimates the daily value of one petahash per second (PH/s) of mining power, consistently stayed above the $100 mark throughout the month. Initially, on March 1, the hashprice started at roughly $103.24 and climbed to $110.39 by the end of the month, as reported by Luxor’s hashrateindex.com. Notably, on March 13, the hashprice for 1 PH/s per day soared past the $120 range. At the time of writing, at block height 837,246, there’s approximately 2,754 blocks left until the fourth halving.

This new device features a hashrate of approximately 234 terahash per second (TH/s) and boasts a much lower energy efficiency of 15 joules per terahash (J/T). Bitmain recently unveiled its latest bitcoin (BTC) mining innovation, featuring an advanced efficiency rating surpassing its earlier models. For instance, the previous air-cooled Antminer S21 delivers 200 terahash per second (TH/s) at an efficiency of approximately 17.5 joules per terahash (J/T). The newly introduced S21 Pro model, however, outperforms with 234 TH/s and an improved efficiency of just 15 J/T. The introduction of the new model occurred at the World Digital Mining Summit (WDMS) held in Oman. This announcement also comes on the heels of Bitmain’s disclosure that its Antminer T21 units are completely sold out as of March 19, 2024. Just a day prior, the company shared insights into the utility of its hydro-cooling solutions in generating heat for applications like fish and shrimp farming, and greenhouse operations. For example, one of Bitmain’s clients, Dongguan Jingyi Trading Co., runs a hydro-cooled mining operation in Central Asia that simultaneously supports a fish farm spanning 3,000 square meters, nurturing the growth of millions of bass and tilapia. Bitmain’s latest mining device boasts one of the best efficiency ratings in the market concerning joules per terahash. As of Friday, detailed information about this new miner, including its price, was not available on the company’s website. Nevertheless, during the WDMS, it was announced that the machine would cost roughly $18.90 per terahash with a coupon, leading to an estimated price of $4,422.60 per unit. The introduction of the new Antminer occurs with just 22 days remaining until the fourth Bitcoin halving event, at which point crypto miners will receive only 3.125 bitcoins per block after the halving.

Marathon revealed it has been developing this technology for about a year. On March 25, 2024, Marathon (Nasdaq: MARA) announced that it was launching new firmware called MARAFW and a control board dubbed the MARA UCB 2100. MARAFW is custom firmware designed to optimize chip settings in bitcoin application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining rigs. Optimizations include increasing hashrate, auto-tuning and the manual customization of settings. “[The firmware] provides options for overclocking to assist in boosting bitcoin production or underclocking for improved efficiency,” Marathon’s announcement detailed. “Additionally, MARAFW includes intelligent thermal protection to defend miners against overheating, thereby protecting their longevity. MARAFW is compatible with the majority of stock control boards, as well as Marathon’s MARA UCB 2100,” the company added. MARA UCB 2100, a proprietary control board crafted internally by Marathon, comes pre-equipped with Marathon’s firmware – MARAFW. This control board facilitates support for a wide range of bitcoin mining rigs and claims to ensure compatibility with numerous mining pools. “One of Marathon’s key differentiators is its vertical tech stack, and for the first time, we are providing the broader mining community with an opportunity to experience some of the proprietary technologies that set Marathon apart,” Fred Thiel, Marathon’s chairman and CEO stated. Marathon isn’t pioneering the concept of bespoke firmware; several entities have already engineered solutions to enhance the efficiency of mining apparatus. For instance, Braiins has introduced its own tailored firmware, Braiins OS+, which enables individual chip tuning to optimize both the hashrate and power efficiency of bitcoin ASIC units. The company claims that Braiins OS+ empowers miners to refine their ASIC miners’ performance, boost efficiency, and mine across various pools, all while slashing data transmission between the mining farm and the pool by 95%. Marathon is confident that its latest offerings will achieve similar successes and is presently deploying MARAFW across its extensive fleet of over 200,000 bitcoin mining rigs. Following the favorable outcomes from these preliminary deployments, Marathon disclosed that it is making both MARAFW and MARA UCB 2100 available to the wider bitcoin mining industry. Moreover, Marathon has revealed that it has already completed sales of MARAFW and MARA UCB2100 to various enterprise customers. “With MARAFW and MARA UCB 2100, we have developed a unique set of complimentary products that we believe can help miners better navigate the upcoming halving and beyond. We invite all parties who are interested in mining like Marathon to contact us and test some of the unique technologies that we are developing to improve profitability, efficiency, and stability,” Thiel stated in his closing remarks of the announcement.

Jakobsdóttir stated that while the country was working to achieve carbon neutrality, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies were “not part of that mission.” Iceland’s allegiance with bitcoin miners might be about to change. Katrín Jakobsdóttir, Prime Minister of Iceland, has criticized the power used by bitcoin mining operations, vowing to divert part of this energy to strengthen the country’s food sovereignty. In an interview with the Financial Times, Jakobsdóttir explained that the country was on a mission to achieve carbon neutrality and that renewable energy should be reallocated to power the 375,000 citizens of Iceland. Jakobsdóttir explained that bitcoin and cryptocurrency, which use “a lot of energy,” were “not part of that mission.” The winter season has affected the power deliveries to the country’s hydroelectric plants. This has made food processing plants turn to dirty energy sources to keep operating, something that has been qualified as “unacceptable” by Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson, Iceland’s environment minister. Jakobsdóttir detailed the difficulties of growing crops in Iceland. She stated: It’s not exactly easy to be a farmer in Iceland. It’s not exactly great fields. But it’s an important part of our strategy for security and safety in this world. It is estimated that bitcoin miners and data centers consume over 120 MW of energy in Iceland, more than what’s consumed by all the households combined. Jakobsdóttir did not detail which methods or regulations would be enacted to achieve this shift.

However, with the anticipated block reward halving, it’s projected that around 100 exahash per second (EH/s) of computing power might be disconnected after the event. As of this moment, Bitcoin’s overall computing power, as measured by the seven-day simple moving average (SMA) on Luxor’s hashrateindex.com, maintains a steady pace at 596 EH/s, having peaked at a historic high of 628 EH/s on March 12, 2024. A recent analysis featured on theminermag.com explores the possible resurgence of private mining operators. “With the recent hashprice rebound, even an old mining machine like M21S could be making some marginal gross profits again at an energy rate of $0.07/kWh,” the report notes. “Hence more private mining companies may have plugged in their machines again over the past few months ahead of the halving to squeeze more juice out of their idle older machines while they still can.” Yet, the analysis further points out that as the halving approaches, outdated application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bitcoin mining devices are expected to retire. This scenario hinges on whether the hashprice dramatically increases to 200 petahash per second (PH/s), according to the analysis. If this happens, older-generation miners could continue to see a lifespan. “Bitcoin’s average hashrate in October was around 450 EH/s and is 600 EH/s in March so far,” the report’s author estimates. The theminermag.com’s report concludes: If we assume the majority of the hashrate increase since October came from older equipment, then we could see a hashrate correction to the low 500 EH/s levels after halving. As of March 23, 2024, the hashprice stands at $99.98 per petahash per second (PH/s) per day, marking an increase from its level just a few months back. Additionally, bitcoin mining revenue for March has already eclipsed that of February, despite the month not yet concluding. Last month, bitcoin miners generated $1.39 billion in block rewards and fees. Data from Saturday afternoon shows that, for March, bitcoin miners have already amassed $1.44 billion in combined fees and block subsidies. At block height 835,953, a mere 4,047 blocks remain until the fourth halving event, which will reduce the block reward from 6.25 bitcoins per block to 3.125 BTC per block post-halving.

With the month drawing to a close in just ten days, the income generated by miners this month is on the verge of exceeding February’s total earnings. Bitcoin (BTC) has successfully maintained its position above the $60,000 mark, providing a significant advantage to miners. This high valuation has pushed the overall hash price beyond the $95 per petahash per second (PH/s) mark since Feb. 28, 2024.

With only ten days remaining in March, miners have so far accumulated $1.33 billion in combined block rewards and fees. This figure is slightly below the $1.39 billion earned in February, indicating that miners are likely to exceed last month’s earnings in the next 24 hours. The subsidy-to-fee ratio for March closely mirrors that of February, with the current month’s unfinished statistics showing $63.77 million in fees compared to last month’s total of $71.56 million.

According to a recent announcement, Luxor and Bitnomial are joining forces to offer exchange-traded hashrate futures tailored for institutional investors. Set to debut on Bitnomial’s derivatives trading platform by the close of March, Luxor emphasized that this financial instrument will equip miners with a means to hedge future income while offering investors an opportunity to engage with hashrate futures on an American exchange. At the heart of the hashrate futures product lies Luxor’s Bitcoin Hashprice Index, a benchmark that gauges the value of 1 petahash per second (PH/s) of SHA256 hashpower. Essentially, the hashprice represents the daily anticipated value of 1 PH/s of hashing power, quantified in U.S. dollars. Currently, the hashprice per PH/s stands just below $100, precisely at $99.70 on March 19, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. It’s worth noting that the hashprice of Bitcoin, as determined by the seven-day simple moving average (SMA), can experience significant fluctuations over time. “Hashrate has one of the highest volatilities of major commodities, and the April 2024 Bitcoin Halving will exacerbate this volatility,” Luxor’s head of derivatives, Matt Williams, remarked on Tuesday. “Bitcoin miners need additional methods to mitigate this price risk to ensure the longevity of their businesses.” Williams continued: Exchange-traded hashrate futures will allow them to quickly move in and out of hedging positions to de-risk their revenue streams, and the revenue certainty should improve their credit profile with lenders, which will lower their cost of securing capital. Presently, according to Luxor’s network data, Bitcoin’s hashrate is coasting along at 600 exahash per second (EH/s) which is equivalent to 600,000 PH/s or 600,000,000 terahash per second (TH/s).

Additionally, post the 2028 halving, miners will receive 1.5625 bitcoin per block as rewards, marking the final occasion that a whole bitcoin will be part of the reward subsidy following the 2032 halving. This year marks a significant milestone for bitcoin (BTC), as its availability is set to decrease with the reward for mining a block dropping from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This adjustment represents a drastic reduction from the 50 BTC per block miners could earn from 2009 to 2012. By April 22, 2010, a quarter of bitcoin’s maximum 21 million supply had been mined. Fast forward to Dec. 14, 2011, and miners had extracted around half of all the BTC. The three-quarters mark was reached on July 29, 2015. By Dec. 13, 2021, the mining process had released 90% of the total bitcoins into circulation. Currently, 93.6% of bitcoin’s total supply has been issued, leaving only 1.34 million BTC yet to be mined. The existing supply of BTC stands at 19,656,761.74 BTC, with a significant portion held by various entities such as public and private companies, governments, exchange-traded products and funds, as well as within decentralized finance (defi) and smart contracts. According to bitcointreasuries.net, these groups collectively possess 2,494,501 BTC. Additionally, cryptoquant.com reports that slightly over 2 million BTC are stored on exchange platforms, amounting to approximately 2,003,753.08 BTC. These holdings, however, are partially owned by customers using these exchanges and their custodial services. Bitcoins that have not moved from their wallets for an extended period, often years, are referred to as “zombie bitcoins.” These may include coins that are lost but cannot be definitively declared as such. Coin Metrics, in a 2019 study, estimated there are about 1.4 million zombie bitcoins, while a 2020 estimate by blockchaincenter.net puts the figure at around 1.7 million. Current figures reveal that entities like public or private corporations, governments, and ETFs hold 11.88% of bitcoin’s total supply. About 9.54% is kept on centralized crypto exchanges, and 8.09% consists of zombie bitcoins, excluding Satoshi Nakamoto’s share, which represents 4.76% of the 21 million cap. With 6.39% of Bitcoin still to be mined, it suggests that 40.66% of the supply is beyond the reach of the average person. Assuming customers control 60% of the BTC on exchanges, this reduces the accessible supply to 34.94%. The halving event in 2028 will reduce mining rewards to 1.5625 BTC per block. By Feb. 20, 2035, we expect 99% of Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap to be mined, totaling approximately 20,790,000 BTC in circulation. At that point, miners will receive 0.78125 BTC per block, and in 2036, the reward will further decrease to 0.390625 BTC at the seventh halving. As the horizon of bitcoin’s next mining epoch approaches, the cryptocurrency’s evolving landscape underlines a foundation in scarcity, altering the fabric of today’s contrasting fiat model.

Bitcoin’s price has remained above $60,000 throughout March, reaching close to $74,000 on March 14. Between onchain fees and the price increase, these factors could offset revenue losses from the halving for miners. However, the halving will make mining much less profitable, particularly for those with high operational costs, potentially leading some to cease operations. Bitcoin’s inflation rate is set to significantly decrease around April 20, 2024, as the fourth halving event reduces miner rewards from 6.25 bitcoins per block to just 3.125. To provide perspective, if the halving took place last year on April 20, 2023, with bitcoin priced at $28,245 each, the scenario would be vastly different. At that time, miners generated approximately $25.42 million daily by mining around 900 BTC. However, post-halving, with only 450 BTC being mined, revenues would have dropped to about $12.71 million.  Currently, bitcoin hovers slightly above the $67,000 mark, translating to daily earnings of $60.3 million from block rewards alone, not including transaction fees. Should the price maintain its current level, the halved daily output of 450 BTC could still net miners $30.15 million, surpassing the $25.42 million earned from 900 bitcoins in April last year. Additionally, miners now earn more per transaction, with the average fee jumping to $8.28 or 37.7 satoshis per virtual byte from April 2023’s $2.05 per transfer. Given the current price is double that of April 2023 and fees have quadrupled, well-established mining operations stand to remain profitable if these trends continue or greatly improve. However, a dip in bitcoin’s price to $50,000, $40,000, or below $30,000 could significantly impact miners’ profitability. Traditionally, halving events have been followed by rises in BTC’s price over the medium to long term, always compensating for the diminished block rewards. Historically, each halving has also been succeeded by a price increase, yet it’s vital to acknowledge that market cycles may not always replicate past patterns. As the ecosystem braces for its next halving, the current backdrop of fluctuating prices and fees paints a complex picture for miners. The interplay between potential revenue streams and the current uncertainty of crypto market values underscores a pivotal moment. The fourth halving may not only test the resilience and adaptability of miners but also set a precedent for the digital currency’s trajectory going forward.

In 2024, BTC is setting new benchmarks with unprecedented price highs, the highest difficulty levels, the biggest block size, and now, over this weekend, its computing power hit an unprecedented peak on March 10, 2024, achieving 618 EH/s. Just six days earlier, on March 4, the hashrate was maintaining a pace at 564 EH/s, according to the seven-day simple moving average (7DSMA). This indicates a notable increase of 9.57% in hashrate from March 4.  The three-day simple moving average (3DSMA) ascended to a high of 661 EH/s. The 7DSMA is a mere 382 EH/s shy of achieving a singular zettahash per second (ZH/s), while the 3DSMA is just 339 EH/s away from reaching the 1 ZH/s milestone. The 7DSMA translates to 618 quintillion hashes per second (H/s), an astoundingly vast figure.

This follows the year’s most significant difficulty escalation of 8.24%, which occurred on Feb. 15. The upcoming adjustment is predicted to record a reduction of 2.5% to 3%, as block time intervals extend beyond the intended ten-minute mark. Just prior to the most recent difficulty increase, Bitcoin’s total hashrate climbed to 609 exahash per second (EH/s) on Feb. 8. Following this achievement, six days later, the difficulty escalated to 81.73 trillion, marking an 8.24% increase. Since that point, it has been the most challenging period in history for discovering BTC blocks. Nonetheless, the hashrate has since receded from its peak, and as of now, the network’s total hashrate is hovering around 577 EH/s, based on the seven-day simple moving average (SMA). Estimated metrics, which could change between now and then, indicate a 2.5% to 3% decrease is anticipated for the next difficulty adjustment, scheduled for Feb. 29, 2024. Currently, block intervals are lagging behind the ten-minute norm, with block times ranging from 10:08 to 10:21 per block, and the adjustment is expected in less than 450 blocks. Additionally, fewer than 4,900 blocks are left until the fourth Bitcoin network halving, projected around April 19, 2024. Should the difficulty decrease on Thursday, it will mark the year’s second reduction. The initial difficulty decrease in 2024 occurred on Jan. 20, dropping 3.9% at block height 826,560. Prior and subsequent adjustments have seen increases of 1.65%, 7.33%, and 8.24%. Currently, Foundry USA dominates the hashrate landscape with 30.41% of the total, equivalent to 178.07 EH/s, while Antpool holds 23.87% with 139.82 EH/s. A total of 52 mining pools are contributing hashrate to the BTC chain, with Viabtc, F2pool, and Mara Pool trailing behind Foundry and Antpool. Miners are poised to earn similar revenue to January, as February’s figures indicate $1.14 billion in earnings, compared to January’s $1.35 billion. As the price hovers above $53,000 on Monday, the estimated value of one petahash per second (PH/s) of hashing power per day has experienced a marked increase.

The company emphasizes the halving event’s potential to reduce mining rewards as a central concern for its future profitability. Riot Platforms (Nasdaq: RIOT) warns that exposure to financially unstable crypto firms could tarnish its reputation and the overall market for bitcoin (BTC), potentially harming its mining operations. The collapse of several crypto platforms has already sown distrust within the industry, leading to increased regulatory scrutiny and a notable decline in BTC’s value. The annual report’s risks section says such challenges could threaten Riot’s profitability and its ability to attract institutional-scale data center clients. The annual report focuses on the fourth bitcoin halving anticipated in April 2024, a mechanism that reduces the block rewards by half. While historical trends have shown price increases around past halvings, Riot Platforms cautions that there’s no guarantee future halvings will favorably impact BTC’s price to offset the reduced mining rewards. “If a corresponding and proportionate increase in the price of bitcoin does not follow future halving events, the revenue we earn from our bitcoin Mining operations would see a decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition,” Riot warns. Riot Platforms points out that as BTC mining rewards have diminished over the years, onchain transaction fees have become a more crucial incentive for miners. However, higher fees may deter bitcoin’s adoption as a payment method, potentially lowering demand and prices. “If demand for bitcoin decreases, causing future bitcoin prices to decrease, the market price of our securities may be materially and adversely affected,” the mining firm notes. The company also highlights scaling challenges, such as high BTC fees and slow transaction settlements, which could hinder broader adoption and, consequently, overall demand for bitcoin. Riot Platforms’ ability to remain competitive depends on its capacity to grow its hashrate in line with the global network, a task that becomes increasingly difficult as more miners join the network. “There is, however, no guarantee that any of the mechanisms in place or being explored for increasing the scale of settlement of cryptocurrency transactions will be effective,” Riot discloses. Despite these challenges, Riot Platforms has actively sought to bolster its position by raising nearly $560 million for significant investments in Microbt mining hardware. This proactive approach could bolster the company’s commitment to navigating the volatile crypto landscape and help Riot obtain a competitive edge in the industry. Riot’s rivals are engaging in identical strategies to brace for the uncertainties associated with the forthcoming halving event.

Although it’s still premature to pinpoint the precise date—given the average ten-minute interval between blocks—the event is anticipated to take place in about 57 days. As we edge closer to Bitcoin’s fourth halving, fewer than 8,316 blocks remain before the mining incentive is slashed in half. The crypto community is abuzz on various social platforms, eagerly exchanging updates and mining data. For those unfamiliar, the halving process is a fundamental part of Bitcoin’s design, halving the block reward every 210,000 blocks. This mechanism is set to ensure that BTC’s total supply gradually approaches, but crucially never exceeds, the 21 million cap, thereby embedding scarcity directly into the protocol. The countdown to the halving now stands at 57 days, positioning the anticipated event to land on or around April 21, 2024. As we approach this milestone, current data shows that miners continue to liquidate their BTC holdings. This preemptive selling by miners, as we head into the fourth halving, indicates a variety of strategies: some may be gathering funds, others are likely addressing operational expenses, investing in technological advancements, or capitalizing on current market values. If the #Bitcoin halving were to happen today, these would be the breakeven power prices for popular rigs! pic.twitter.com/ATIZdUFbFm — Hashrate Index 🟧⛏️ (@hashrateindex) February 22, 2024 This behavior isn’t new; miners have traditionally sold off BTC a few months before past halvings to secure the necessary finances for equipment upgrades and to brace for the impending decrease in block rewards. Over the last six months, miners have been aggressively acquiring tens of thousands of new machines. For instance, on Thursday, Hive Digital announced its acquisition of 1,000 next-generation S21 Bitmain bitcoin miners, enhancing their arsenal by replacing older application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) models. Currently, the daily expected value for each petahash per second (PH/s) of hashing capacity stands at $81. Should the halving event cut block rewards in half and bitcoin’s market price remains constant, the daily value derived from each PH/s of hashing power would drop to approximately $40. This anticipated reduction in profitability is the driving force behind the surge in purchases and pre-orders of mining equipment as the halving event draws near. Operations gearing up for the upgrade are well aware of the critical stakes involved, recognizing that survival hinges on their preparedness. The impending reward reduction poses a significant threat, capable of undermining any business that hasn’t adequately braced for this severe shift. As the halving event looms, the Bitcoin community braces for a pivotal shift, underscoring the adapt-or-perish reality facing miners. The strategic liquidation and acquisition frenzy highlights a sector on the cusp of transformation. With survival as the driving force, the narrative may extend beyond mere preparation.

The legal battle underscores the escalating tension between bitcoin mining operations and regulatory oversight, particularly around energy consumption concerns. The plaintiffs, Riot Platforms and the Texas Blockchain Council (TBC) argue that the DOE’s attempt to gather detailed energy usage data from bitcoin miners, under the guise of an emergency action, breaches the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The court filing highlights the DOE’s expedited request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for emergency survey deployment as not only baseless but also lacking in the necessary procedural safeguards, such as public notice and opportunity for comment, mandated by the PRA. “This is a case about sloppy government process, contrived and self-inflicted urgency, and invasive government data collection,” the lawsuit emphasizes. Central to Riot and TBC’s contention is the assertion that the survey imposes an undue burden on respondents, compelling them to disclose sensitive, confidential, and proprietary information without lawful authority. This, they argue, not only infringes on their rights but also sets a dangerous precedent for governmental overreach into private sector operations, potentially harming the competitive standing of U.S. bitcoin mining operations on a global scale. “TBC’s members face a sufficiently imminent and credible threat of government enforcement if they do not respond to the survey,” the filing adds. “Riot has estimated that it has already expended more than 40 employee hours attempting to respond to the initial survey. That is eighty times the estimated burden of 0.5 hours that EIA estimated it would take to complete the survey.” Moreover, the lawsuit underscores the plaintiffs’ belief that the DOE’s actions were not motivated by a genuine concern for public harm or energy stability but were rather influenced by political pressures aiming to curb the cryptocurrency mining industry’s growth. Throughout the court filing, they point to previous public and legislative scrutiny over the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining as a backdrop to the DOE’s sudden and aggressive data collection efforts. The court filing essentially seeks a “temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction prohibiting [the] defendants [the] Department of Energy and Energy Information Administration from collecting EIA- 862 data from identified commercial cryptocurrency miners.” By challenging the DOE, Riot, and TBC seek not only to protect their proprietary information but also to affirm the principle that regulatory actions must adhere to established legal frameworks and procedures. The outcome of this lawsuit could have significant implications for the balance between regulatory oversight and the autonomy of the cryptocurrency industry, particularly in areas as critical as energy consumption and environmental impact.

Concurrently, Cleanspark announced an enhancement in its fleet-wide operating hashrate, surpassing 14 EH/s. On Thursday, Terawulf (Nasdaq: WULF) announced the repayment of a $22 million term loan, enhancing the company’s cash flow. Up to now, Terawulf has settled $40 million in loans and anticipates another debt clearance in April, leveraging the profits from the first quarter. Additionally, Terawulf reported an increase in its total computational power to 7.6 EH/s, with expectations to reach 8 EH/s by the end of Q1. The company also shared progress on its Lake Mariner facility, projecting an uplift in its hashrate to 10 EH/s by mid-2024. “Over the past year, we have remained resolute in fulfilling our commitment to deleveraging, marking a significant financial milestone for the company,” Terawulf’s CFO Patrick Fleury said in a statement. “With our industry-leading cost to mine bitcoin, we are poised to achieve another substantial debt repayment in the first week of April from the cash generated in the first quarter.” On the same day, Cleanspark (Nasdaq: CLSK) disclosed that the company completed energizing the first 100 MW of its expansion at it’s Sandersville, Georgia facility.

On Thursday, at the milestone of block 830,592, the network experienced its fourth adjustment this year with a sharp 8.24% uptick. Mining bitcoin (BTC) has become considerably more challenging, following an 8.24% increase in network difficulty on Thursday. This uptick is the most substantial of the year, succeeding a 7.33% rise seen two weeks or 2,016 blocks earlier. Among the four adjustments recorded, three have resulted in increases. The latest adjustment pushes the difficulty level to a record-breaking 81.73 trillion. Currently, with the difficulty set at 81.73 trillion, mining a valid block requires hitting a remarkably narrow target amid a broad spectrum of possible hash values. The upcoming difficulty adjustment is scheduled for Feb. 28, 2024. As of now, miners have 1,987 blocks left to navigate before this change. The network’s hashrate is currently stable at 570 exahash per second (EH/s), led by Foundry USA with a commanding 34.25%. Foundry boasts an average hashrate of about 195.43 EH/s, based on data from the past three days. Close behind is Antpool, with 149.83 EH/s or 26.26% of the total network hashrate, followed by Viabtc, F2pool, Binance Pool, and Mara Pool. Presently, around 56 mining pools contribute their hashrate to the Bitcoin network. Additionally, the hash price, representing the value of one petahash per second (PH/s) per day, stands at $83, having decreased from Wednesday’s peak of $91 per PH/s. This dramatic increase in Bitcoin’s mining difficulty underscores the network’s escalating security and competitive edge, while also spotlighting the rising investments and technological progress needed in the mining industry. As the mining community grapples with these intensified conditions, shifts in its dynamics are anticipated, potentially shaping Bitcoin’s economic framework and its attractiveness to both current and potential stakeholders.

Current projections forecast an estimated difficulty surge ranging from 8.45% to 9.2%, setting the record for the steepest increase of 2024 thus far. This week, bitcoin (BTC) mining is expected to become significantly more challenging, with projections indicating potentially the largest difficulty hike witnessed this year. To date, 2024 has seen three difficulty epochs, comprising one decrease and two increases. The previous uptick, recorded at block height 828,576 on Feb. 2, 2024, marked a 7.33% increase. Forecasts now suggest the forthcoming rise could range from 8.45% to 9.2%, potentially eclipsing the prior adjustment. The network’s difficulty adjustment mechanism aims to maintain block production times close to an average of ten minutes per block. This adjustment occurs every 2,016 blocks, based on the time required to mine the preceding epoch. Should the 2,016 blocks be mined in under two weeks, an increase is usually on the cards. Conversely, if mining the epoch exceeds two weeks, indicating block times have stretched beyond the ten-minute norm, a decrease in difficulty is expected. Presently, at block height 830,287, block intervals are averaging between eight minutes and 45 seconds to nine minutes and seven seconds for each block discovered. The seven-day simple moving average (SMA) for Bitcoin’s hashrate is smoothly maintaining a pace of 597 exahash per second (EH/s). Throughout the recent mining of 2,016 blocks, the average hashrate recorded for this period stood at 586.3 EH/s. With 9,715 blocks remaining until the anticipated fourth reward halving, scheduled on or around April 19, 2024, miners have been ramping up the network’s computational strength and difficulty to unprecedented levels every few weeks.

The African country’s pursuit of foreign exchange has seemingly taken precedence over the concerns often raised by climate change advocates. Ethiopia’s state power company has entered into power supply agreements with 21 bitcoin miners. These deals have not only positioned the African nation as one of the world’s leading destinations for bitcoin mining machines but have opened a potentially lucrative source of foreign exchange. A Bloomberg report, citing Nuo Xu, the founder of the China Digital Mining Association, suggests that Ethiopia’s contracts with bitcoin miners, combined with the recent coming online of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), will gradually make it a favored destination for Chinese bitcoin miners. To put this into perspective, of the 21 bitcoin miners that have secured power supply agreements with the Ethiopian power company, only two are non-Chinese. Meanwhile, the report indicates that Ethiopia’s pursuit of foreign exchange appears to have taken precedence over the concerns of anti-bitcoin climate change advocates. Yet, according to Nemo Semret, the CEO of QRB Labs, this has not deterred the country from enforcing strict requirements on miners. “Ethiopia is heavily regulated. Introducing a new sector like this has been a big challenge, and we’ve been working for the last two years to get all the necessary permissions from the government,” Semret reportedly said. The CEO also revealed that the government of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has issued a directive to regulate “cryptographic products,” including mining. While the long-term future of these miners in Ethiopia remains uncertain, the dam’s hydropower could potentially address criticisms often raised about bitcoin mining’s perceived disproportionate use of non-renewable energy sources. Furthermore, the altitude of Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, situated 2,400 meters above sea level, provides average temperatures ideal for mining. According to bitcoin mining experts quoted in the report, these are some of the attributes that make Ethiopia a possible rival to the U.S. State of Texas.

Over the last year, figures reveal a staggering increase in Bitcoin’s hashrate, surging by 332 quintillion hashes per second. On Feb. 8, 2024, the hashrate targeting the Bitcoin (BTC) network hit a record peak, ascending to 609 EH/s, according to the seven-day SMA. Data from the three-day SMA shows a peak at 617 EH/s, while 30-day metrics show a height of 551 EH/s. The surge in hashrate aligns with BTC’s significant increase in value, as the leading crypto asset by market cap breached the $45K mark per unit on Thursday. This uptick in BTC’s market value has elevated the daily expected earnings from one petahash per second (PH/s), or one quadrillion hashes per second (H/s), moving up from $74.91 to the present rate of $79.61.  Over the last year, Bitcoin’s hashrate has been on an impressive upward trajectory, with a substantial increase of 332 EH/s recorded since Feb. 7, 2023. Miners recently navigated through a 7.33% increase in mining difficulty on Feb. 2, 2024, with the forthcoming adjustment anticipated on Feb. 15.

The ascension in Bitcoin’s hashrate is attributable to several catalysts, including the climb in BTC prices. Additionally, the introduction of new, more efficient mining rigs that boast greater terahash outputs and reduced energy consumption per terahash has played a crucial role.

Alongside these Mississippi locations, the firm also secured a site in Dalton, Georgia, which is in the midst of construction. On Tuesday, Cleanspark (Nasdaq: CLSK) revealed its Mississippi expansion strategy, having completed a purchase agreement for three fully equipped bitcoin mining facilities, shelling out $19.8 million in cash. Cleanspark shared that these Mississippi data centers will contribute approximately 2.4 exahash per second (EH/s) to the firm’s total mining capabilities. Furthermore, the company has acquired an additional facility in Dalton, Georgia, which is currently under development. This site is anticipated to contribute an additional 0.8 EH/s to Cleanspark’s operations upon activation. Together with the expansion of its existing Dalton mining campus, the company anticipates achieving a combined capacity of 2.4 EH/s in Dalton once these facilities are fully operational. Cleanspark anticipates that with the forthcoming activation of its Sandersville location, alongside recent expansions and new acquisitions, it aims to surpass 20 EH/s by the first half of 2024. Zach Bradford, CEO of Cleanspark, expressed enthusiasm about the expansion into Mississippi and the latest acquisition in Dalton, noting, “I’m pleased to announce our expansion into nearby Mississippi and for our newest acquisition in Dalton, which will not only strengthen our ties in this vibrant community but also improve our operating efficiencies as we prepare for the halving.” Bradford further remarked on the operational growth in Dalton, stating: Given our existing footprint in Dalton, we expect to nearly triple our hashrate there with minimal increases to our overhead operating costs. Cleanspark’s strategic expansion follows its agreement with Bitmain to purchase 160,000 S21 Antminer-brand bitcoin miners, positioning it competitively among a multitude of other mining corporations also securing tens of thousands of bitcoin miners from Bitmain, Microbt, and Canaan. Following this announcement, Cleanspark’s CLSK shares experienced a 7.67% rise over the past day, with a 2.33% increase observed over the past five days. Despite these gains, CLSK shares have seen a 21.4% decline over the last 30 days. What do you think about Cleanspark’s expansion?

This marked the most substantial increase in difficulty for the year thus far. The current level of difficulty stands at 75.50 trillion, reaffirming its status as the most challenging period for bitcoin mining to date. Bitcoin (BTC) mining has recently become a far more challenging endeavor, with the difficulty metric rising by an impressive 7.33%, marking the most significant increase in 2024. This notable rise comes on the heels of a 3.90% decrease observed on Jan. 20. 2024 has witnessed a total of two increases and one reduction in mining difficulty thus far. Additionally, we are now counting down to the fourth halving event, which is less than 11,500 blocks away and will lead to a halving of BTC mining rewards. The 7.33% rise in difficulty marks a historic ascent to an all-time peak of 75.50 trillion. In essence, this figure represents the threshold at which a block’s hash must reside to be deemed valid. With the difficulty now standing at 75.50 trillion, it implies that the hash of an acceptable block must be equal to or lower than an exceptionally diminutive target value within the extensive spectrum of possible hash values. The smaller this target becomes, the less probable it is for a random hash guess to fall below it, thereby intensifying the challenge of discovering a valid block. Currently, the collective hashrate is cruising steadily at 536 exahash per second (EH/s), as indicated by seven-day simple moving average (SMA) data from Luxor’s web portal hashrateindex.com. This figure of 536 EH/s trails slightly behind the all-time peak of 566 EH/s reached on Jan. 29, 2024. Examining three-day block discovery metrics unveils the dominance of two pools over Bitcoin’s hashrate, collectively accounting for over 60% of the total. Foundry USA leads the charge with a commanding 31.94%, boasting 173.53 EH/s, while Antpool closely follows with 159.17 EH/s, constituting 29.30% of the overall hashrate.

Despite experiencing a slight decline in mid-January, the network’s hashrate is on an upward trajectory, in anticipation of the expected difficulty adjustment set for Feb. 2, 2024.  On Jan. 30, 2024, Bitcoin’s total hashrate achieved a milestone, reaching 566 EH/s, as evidenced by the seven-day simple moving average (SMA). It’s natural to question why higher hashrate figures might appear higher in 24-hour or three-day analyses. The discrepancy arises because these shorter-term metrics are commonly used but don’t offer the same consistency as the seven-day SMA.  Luxor‘s mining operation, through its website hashrateindex.com, clarifies that most analyses typically focus on periods covering three days (432 blocks), seven days (1,008 blocks), and 30 days (4,320 blocks), highlighting the varied approaches to measuring Bitcoin’s computational strength. “The downside of the 3-day view is that faster or shorter blocks can distort the hashrate estimate, making Bitcoin’s total hashrate appear larger or smaller than it really is,” the website notes. Luxor’s summary adds: While less current than the 3-day, the 7-day or 1,008 blocks hashrate metric is less influenced by bitcoin mining luck and block times, and so miners see it as a more accurate estimate. The 7D is the industry standard for hashrate reporting. After reaching a peak of 566 EH/s, the latest seven-day simple moving average (SMA) data indicates that the network’s computational capacity is currently maintaining a steady pace at 552 EH/s. Data from a three-day period revealed the network achieved a maximum of 598 EH/s on Jan. 12, 2024, as per the shorter-duration analysis. Miners are bracing for an anticipated hike in mining difficulty, expected to occur within the next 24 hours, which will render BTC mining more challenging.

This decrease was primarily attributed to the severe cold in Texas, leading many miners to pause their operations temporarily. By Jan. 21, 2024, the hashrate’s seven-day simple moving average (SMA) dipped under the 500 exahash per second (EH/s) mark, plunging to a year’s low at 482 EH/s. However, since this low, the hashrate has rebounded, showing a 10.99% increase to 535 EH/s. In the past six days, the hashrate of Bitcoin ascended to 535 EH/s, according to the seven-day SMA from Luxor’s hashrateindex.com. The three-day SMA highlights a zenith of 559 EH/s, while the monthly average is recorded at 522 EH/s. The seven-day indicators point to a 10.99% surge from the trough of 482 EH/s, leading to block times now marginally outpacing the standard ten-minute interval. Presently, block durations fluctuate between eight minutes and 52 seconds to nine minutes and 21 seconds. As block intervals consistently undercut the typical ten-minute benchmark and the hashrate gathers steam, an impending network difficulty adjustment, expected around Feb. 2, 2024, is likely to bring an increase. Current forecasts hint at a mining difficulty rise ranging between 1.21% and 6.9%. Since January’s onset, miners have collected roughly $1.1 billion in fees and subsidies combined. From this amount, $120.46 million was derived from transaction fees, while block rewards contributed $977.7 million. Data from Jan. 26 shows Bitcoin’s hash price at approximately $79.23 per petahash per second (PH/s) per day. The hash price, which reflects the daily estimated earnings of 1 PH/s of hashing power, has dropped more than 23% from its monthly high of $103.77 per PH/s per day. According to three-day figures, Foundry USA dominates as the leading pool with 152.23 EH/s, constituting 28.10% of the overall hashrate. Antpool follows with 139.92 EH/s (25.83% of the total), and Viabtc with 71.64 EH/s, representing 13.22% of the collective. Monthly data reveals Foundry holding 29.34% of the total hashrate, having mined 1,272 blocks out of the 4,336 found so far. As the network deals with the latest hashrate shifts, its ongoing resilience and adaptability to market dynamics remain evident. The fluctuations in Bitcoin’s hashrate are significant for the network and its users, as they directly impact the security and efficiency of verifying transactions. A lower hashrate can lead to slower transaction processing times. These changes also affect miners’ profitability, as the difficulty of mining adjusts based on the total hashrate. As the fourth halving event looms only 12,370 blocks away, miners are intensifying their operations to secure the highest rewards before they are halved.

The company shared on Thursday its anticipation of achieving 8 exahash per second (EH/s) by March 2024. Up to this point, Swan’s mining subsidiary has successfully mined 750 bitcoin. Swan Bitcoin, specializing in bitcoin-centric financial services, recently emerged from stealth mode with its BTC mining subsidiary, Swan Mining. Swan reports that its mining activities currently boast 4 EH/s of hashpower, with plans to expand this capacity by March 2024. “The unit has purchased and taken delivery of mining equipment that will bring its total capacity to more than 8 exahash, expecting full deployment by March,” the firm stated on Thursday. Since its inception, Swan Mining has forged “several major strategic partnerships with major industry players,” as outlined by the company’s announcement. The update omits specifics regarding the industry collaborators, the varieties of mining units utilized, or the location of its facility. Swan has reported that since the start of its mining operations, the company has successfully mined 750 BTC. “Swan Mining developed and deployed at warp speed,” said Rapha Zagury, CIO at Swan and head of Swan Mining. “Our understanding is that this is the fastest-ever initial deployment of hashrate at this scale in Bitcoin history. We are proud to play a role in keeping bitcoin mining decentralized,” Zagury added. Swan’s foray into the sector coincides with a competitive rush to acquire new mining units and enlarge facilities. Over the past six months, companies have invested heavily in acquiring tens of thousands of BTC mining rigs from leading producers such as Canaan, Bitmain, and Microbt.

This follows a successful acquisition of $25 million in a similar preferred share sale conducted by Canaan last year. Canaan (Nasdaq: CAN), known for producing Avalon-branded application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bitcoin mining rigs, successfully garnered $50 million by selling preferred shares. This financial boost was highlighted in a January 2024 SEC Form 6-K filing, revealing that the shares were purchased by an undisclosed “institutional buyer.” This announcement comes on the heels of Canaan’s previous venture in the previous year, where on Nov. 27, 2023, the company sold shares amounting to $25 million. The ASIC producer has specified that these funds will be allocated towards research and development as well as covering the company’s operational expenses. Established for a significant period, Canaan is recognized for launching the first publicly-available ASIC miner in 2013. Canaan marked its entry into the public market with an initial public offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq Global Market in 2019. The firm debuted on Nasdaq on Nov. 21, 2019, with the ticker symbol “CAN,” amassing $90 million from the IPO.

According to Batten, 54.5% of the energy used for this activity is sustainable, and the industry is mitigating 7.3% of all its emissions directly, which constitutes a new record for any industry without offsets. Bitcoin mining is getting greener, according to a recent article issued by Daniel Batten, co-founder of CH4 Capital, a methane mitigation solutions provider. He estimates that, according to his calculations, the Bitcoin mining grid is now using 54.5% sustainable energy, being the only global industry that is majorly powered by this kind of energy. In his Bitcoin ESG Forecast #003, Batten disputes the idea that Bitcoin mining is a fossil fuel-powered industry. He acknowledges that until Q3 2022, it was. However, after the Chinese mining ban was enacted, miners moved their operations to greener on-grid sites or sustainable off-grid locations. Criticizing Cambridge’s model on bitcoin emissions as outdated, Batten stated: There are no longer any independent models or studies using contemporary data that support the thesis Bitcoin is mainly powered by fossil fuels. In addition, Batten’s research revealed that more Bitcoin miners were using methane emissions than previously accounting for, with undisclosed companies using vented gas to power their mining operations. The process, that uses methane to provide electricity for these operations, still leaves a carbon dioxide byproduct; nonetheless, Batten explained that methane is 84x more warming than CO2 over 20 years, and using it is better than letting it vent straight into the atmosphere. 22 mining companies are mitigating methane emissions, providing a direct offset of 7.3% of network emissions without relying on carbon instruments.

As a result, the network’s mining difficulty now stands at 70.34 trillion, with the next adjustment anticipated on Feb. 4, 2024. Mining bitcoin (BTC), the leading crypto asset in terms of market capitalization, has become slightly more feasible for miners following this recent difficulty modification. This change took place on Jan. 20, 2024, at block height 826,560, rendering the process of discovering a block reward 3.9% less challenging than during the preceding two weeks. Previously, the difficulty level was pegged at 73.19 trillion, but it has now declined to the present figure of 70.34 trillion.  The current difficulty of 70.34 trillion defines the maximum threshold for the hash of a block to be deemed valid. In essence, when the difficulty is set at 70.34 trillion, it implies that the hash of a valid block must not exceed a target number, which is exceedingly small compared to the full spectrum of potential hash values. The existing difficulty level will maintain its stance for a span of 2,016 blocks, typically a period of two weeks. The subsequent epoch is forecasted to unfold on or around Feb. 4, 2024.  On Jan. 20, approximately 51 different mining entities or pools are dedicating hashrate to the Bitcoin blockchain. Foundry USA wields the most might with 29.43% of the total hashrate over the past three days with 139.89 exahash per second (EH/s) of hashpower. Antpool commands 22.49% of the aggregate commanding around 106.90 EH/s of SHA256 hashpower. Foundry’s and Antpool’s lead is followed by F2pool, Viabtc, and Binance Pool respectively. Currently, the total hashrate hovers just below the 500 EH/s mark, registering 497 EH/s on Jan. 20, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. This figure is slightly below the seven-day simple moving average (SMA) of 547 EH/s, which was noted five days earlier on Jan. 15, 2024. This indicates that the network has experienced a reduction of approximately 50 EH/s in under a week. The decrease in hashpower is primarily due to scaled-back operations in Texas, where mining businesses have reduced their activity to allow the grid to manage the extreme subzero temperatures impacting the state.

Additionally, since Dec. 4, 2023, these fees have predominantly been over $10, with a single exception occurring when it briefly fell to $8.33 per transaction. In 2024, the cost of the average onchain transaction fees has surged compared to the previous year. Over the last 46 days, these fees have consistently exceeded $10 per transaction, with the sole exception being Jan. 13, 2024, when they momentarily dipped to $8.33. Throughout January this year, miners have amassed over $800 million in a combination of new BTC and transaction fees. Over the last 46 days, median transaction fees on the Bitcoin network have consistently stayed above $3. Despite January showing stronger performance compared to most months in 2023, the recent decline in bitcoin’s value has impacted miner revenues. This downturn follows the mass approval of 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, leading to a bearish trend in BTC’s spot market behavior. For instance, around Dec. 20, 2023, the daily value of one petahash per second (PH/s) of hashpower was nearly $120. By Jan. 19, 2024, this value had decreased by 34.59%, dropping to $78.48 per PH/s per day. Bitcoin miners also curtailed the hashrate this month leading to a significant drop in overall hashpower. The situation has been influenced by an increase in block time intervals between the previous difficulty adjustment and the upcoming retarget. As a result, bitcoin miners might receive some relief on Saturday during the retarget epoch, with current estimates suggesting a potential decrease in mining difficulty. It’s projected that there could be a 4.4% reduction in difficulty, which may ease some of the pressure. However, the declining price of bitcoin continues to erode revenues. Additionally, miners are facing the challenge of processing a backlog exceeding 250,000 unconfirmed transactions. Amid heightened transaction fees and fluctuating mining income, the impending halving looms as a critical juncture for the industry, with fewer than 14,000 blocks remaining. The recent downturn in price and the forecasted difficulty recalibration might herald a small change in mining operations, with market stability possibly affecting future earnings and the stability of the network.

This has freed up much needed electricity capacity in the state, while also leading to a sharp drop in the global Bitcoin hashrate. The plummeting temperatures sweeping through Texas have led to a significant drop in Bitcoin’s hashrate. As the Lone Star State battles with subzero conditions, bitcoin miners are curtailing operations, contributing to a notable 34% decrease in the global Bitcoin hashrate. In a great thread on X preceding the freezing weather, James Mcavity, CEO of Cormint, Inc., described the impact of the current winter storm on the state’s power grid and the consequent response from Bitcoin miners. There is a big winter storm crossing the country right now. This storm will put a strain on power grids If prices get above $.1 – $.2 per kWh 95% of the bitcoin mining load will be offline across Texas, as usual. Let’s have a look at the storm & take a trip down memory lane 🧵 pic.twitter.com/esn9YfWqRf — James McAvity (@jamesmcavity) January 12, 2024 “If prices get above $.1 – $.2 per kWh 95% of the bitcoin mining load will be offline across Texas, as usual,” said Mcavity. This response mirrors a similar situation on Sep. 6, 2023, when Bitcoin miners responded to emergency conditions by curtailing operations to free up around 2,000 MW of capacity for residential use. Mcavity was right, the bitcoin miners went offline. According to data from Ycharts, the Bitcoin network’s total 24-hour hashrate plummeted from over 629 exahash per second (EH/s) on Jan. 11 to around 415 EH/s by Jan. 15. The decrease aligns with the onset of freezing temperatures in Texas, a state that significantly contributes to the United States’ bitcoin mining activities. Nic Carter, general partner at Castle Island Ventures and vocal Bitcoin advocate, explained the knock-on effects the weather can have on the cost of bitcoin fees. When Texas experiences a power shortage, the price of power naturally rises. “As a general rule of thumb, bitcoin miners in Texas are generally not operating when power prices are high,” Carter said. The Texas miners curtail their efforts, which is beneficial for grid stability but leads to the Bitcoin hashrate dropping. This in turn, “will drive down block arrival time (because bitcoin difficulty can’t react in time),” causing the mempool to fill up. So net new transactional demand will be expressed in the form of higher fees… So new transactions will have to further outbid them to get into blocks. Hence fees will probably rise on Bitcoin due to the cold weather in Texas. Despite the challenges, many mining firms have adapted by participating in demand response programs organized by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). These programs compensate miners for adjusting their load during high-demand periods, exemplifying a symbiotic relationship between bitcoin mining and grid management. As Texas navigates these extreme weather conditions, the state’s unique energy infrastructure and its interplay with bitcoin mining could serve as a model for other states in meeting and responding to power demands.

Before these halving epochs, especially preceding the 2016 and 2020 events, certain skeptics of bitcoin predicted a ‘mining death spiral’ accompanied by substantial miner capitulation. In the past, bitcoin detractors have claimed that a mining death spiral could occur post-halving due to reduced block rewards. They argue that this decrease in profitability may lead to miners exiting the network en masse, resulting in a drop in hashing power, slower transaction times, and potential security vulnerabilities, thus destabilizing the entire Bitcoin network. However, a 2020 research study by Coinshares dismissed these concerns as “highly theoretical edge cases without any historical real-world precedent.” As the 2024 halving nears, these once-prominent theoretical concerns have significantly diminished. Up to this point, two key developments have enhanced the earnings of bitcoin miners: the anticipation of a U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval and the burgeoning Ordinal inscription trend. Mining revenue saw a substantial rise throughout 2023 and this trend has persisted into the new year. The positive sentiment surrounding the potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF has boosted BTC’s value, consequently increasing the network’s hash price. The surge in activity, coupled with the popularity of Ordinal inscription minting, has significantly raised transaction fees. If these trends persist, miners might not experience a significant impact from these changes. Although current fees are lower than last month, they remain notably higher than the same period last year. The potential approval of an ETF has led crypto enthusiasts to anticipate significant demand for bitcoin from these publicly traded funds, potentially maintaining BTC’s high price for an extended period. As with previous halvings, the outcome remains uncertain, and bitcoin miners have historically operated under tight conditions. However, major mining operations with substantial capital are scaling up their hashrate significantly by acquiring thousands of advanced mining rigs. With these more efficient miners and increased hashrate outputs, coupled with the potential price support from an ETF and higher fees due to inscriptions, bitcoin miners are expected to remain resilient, similar to their experience during the past three halving events.

Scheduled for delivery in the next quarter, this purchase represents approximately 12 exahash per second (EH/s) of hashing power. Moreover, Cleanspark has secured the option to purchase up to an additional 100,000 S21 Antminers at a fixed price of $16 per terahash. Cleanspark (Nasdaq: CLSK) disclosed its procurement of mining hardware capable of 12 EH/s, a transaction valued at $193 million. The recently unveiled S21 bitcoin miners stand out for their high hashrate output and enhanced energy efficiency, measured in joules per terahash (J/T). According to Cleanspark’s announcement on Monday, the delivery of the 60,000 Antminer S21s is scheduled between April and June 2024 “We are ready to expand into the next bull market,” Zach Bradford, the CEO of Cleanspark stated. The acquisition of 12 EH/s of hashing capacity is anticipated to elevate Cleanspark’s total production beyond 20 EH/s. Additionally, Cleanspark maintains the opportunity to acquire up to 100,000 more miners from Bitmain at a consistent rate of $16 per terahash until the year’s end. Should Cleanspark exercise its call option, its hashing capacity could rise to 50 EH/s, marking a 400% surge from its present capacity. The company said it chose the Antminer S21 units over the newer T21 models due to the S21’s superior performance. “After receiving initial units, and performing real-world testing, we have determined that the S21 is more efficient and better suited for our operations,” Bradford clarified on Monday. Cleanspark’s strategic move to acquire new hardware is part of an industry-wide rush for cutting-edge machines in anticipation of the forthcoming Bitcoin halving event. Industry peers like Hive Digital Technologies, Cipher Mining, and Iris Energy have also ramped up their arsenal, procuring thousands of next-generation mining rigs. Last month, the bitcoin mining giant Riot Platforms disclosed its acquisition of 66,560 units of Microbt’s latest Whatsminer M66S models. Additionally, Riot has entered an agreement similar to Cleanspark’s with Bitmain, securing a call option for an additional 75 EH/s of mining equipment from Microbt. Cleanspark, too, is gearing up for the impending bull market and halving event. “This strategic agreement enhances our operational efficiency, provides massive optionality, and positions us to maximize opportunities that we expect on the horizon,” stated Bradford in the company’s announcement.

Though the hashrate dipped post-Dec. 25, 2023, falling from 546 EH/s to a low of 510 EH/s, it rebounded amidst a declining hash price and an intervening hike in difficulty. Bitcoin’s seven-day average hashrate achieved a new peak on Jan. 6, 2024, hitting 549 EH/s. This milestone surpassed the former record set on Dec. 25, 2023, when it reached 546 EH/s on Christmas Day. The 549 EH/s equates to 549 quintillion hashes per second (H/s) or 0.549 zettahash per second (ZH/s). One zettahash represents 1,000 EH/s or 1,000,000 petahash per second (PH/s).  Currently, the three-day simple moving average (SMA) indicates the hashrate peaked at 565 EH/s, yet the same three-day SMA documented on Dec. 25, reveals a superior high of 580 EH/s. As of Jan. 7, 2024, exactly 50 mining pools are actively contributing hashrate to the Bitcoin network, with three-day SMA data positioning Foundry USA at the forefront. Over the recent three days, Foundry has dominated with 26.93% of the hashrate, delivering 141.59 EH/s, while Antpool closely follows, committing 139.13 EH/s and securing 26.46% of the overall hashrate. Trailing behind are F2pool, Viabtc, Binance Pool, and Marathon’s Mara Pool. This rise in hashrate coincides with a dip in the hash price per petahash per second (PH/s) value and a recent 1.65% increase in difficulty. Despite the strong hashrate, projections indicate a potential decrease ranging from 1.59% to 8.5% due to slower block intervals compared to the expected 10-minute average, with recent blocks clocking in between 10 minutes and 32 seconds to 10 minutes and 55 seconds.

Ranga is among those experts who foresee BTC reaching its zenith once more in 2024, ultimately closing the year around the $100,000 mark per unit. “The primary catalyst of the current crypto bull market has been the vast inflow of institutional capital following the SEC’s approval of the first bitcoin spot', metadata={'source': '643746', 'row': 136, 'date': '2024-04-18 10:03:20', 'categories': 'Markets and Prices'}),\n"," Document(page_content='the SEC’s approval of the first bitcoin spot [exchange-traded funds] (ETFs),” Ranga remarked. “Demand is already outstripping supply, reportedly by a factor of 10.
