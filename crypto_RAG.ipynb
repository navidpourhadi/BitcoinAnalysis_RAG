LayerZero has made it so users wanting to claim the tokens are required to donate a small amount of money per ZRO token. \\n\\n LayerZero forecasted that the donations would result in approximately $18.5 million being donated to Protocol Guild, a collective funding mechanism for Ethereum ETHUSD developers. \\n\\n The move was met with a wave of backlash from the crypto community as users argued that having to pay a “tax” changes the nature of the “airdrop” to something more like an initial coin offering (ICO). \\n\\n Additional reporting by Geraint Price, Sam Bourgi and Felix Ng. \\n\\n '}\n",

Despite some recovery of intraday losses, the market remains in a bearish mood.Cointelegraph \\n\\n Germany sell pressure more than compensated by MicroStrategy’s BTC purchase \\n\\n Some analysts suggested that a large sale of Bitcoin by the German government caused the crypto market downturn. However, this explanation overlooks the fact that traditional finance investors reacted to unfavorable macroeconomic data. Traders are concerned that the stock market may have peaked and that the U.S. fiscal situation is weakening. \\n\\n According to the onchain crypto analytics firm Arkham, a wallet linked to the German government transferred 6,500 BTC to exchanges on June 19, worth $425 million at the time. Arkham claims that the wallet held nearly 50,000 Bitcoin, believed to have been seized from the pirated movie website Movie2k, which operated in 2013. The evidence suggests that this entity sent BTC to Kraken, Bitstamp, and Coinbase, leaving little doubt about its origin and effective sale. \\n\\n However, this theory is flawed because the U.S.-based business intelligence firm MicroStrategy disclosed on June 20 that it purchased an additional 11,931 BTC for $786 million. Thus, MicroStrategy\\'s buy covered the selling pressure, including the two-day $292 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. \\n\\n Given that no other regulatory changes or events could have negatively impacted the sentiment of cryptocurrency investors in the past couple of days, one should focus on the traditional finance industry, particularly on macroeconomic data. Despite the short-term correlation between the S&P 500 index and the crypto sector, traders typically exit risk-on positions during periods of uncertainty. \\n\\n U.S. futures and options expiry and worsening global macroeconomic conditions \\n\\n According to Bloomberg, the U.S. stock market is facing a \"triple witching,\" an event that occurs every quarter when derivatives contracts tied to stock, index options, and futures are scheduled to mature. An aggregate of $5.5 trillion is set to expire on June 21, and as the S&P 500 nears its all-time high, investors fear that weaker macroeconomic data indicate a higher recession risk. \\n\\n Existing home sales in the U.S. fell for the third consecutive month in May, while the manufacturing and services PMI readings for France and Germany came in below expectations. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the PMI showed that private-sector companies reported slower growth than expected. Lastly, Japan\\'s inflation rose to 2.8% in May, higher than April\\'s figure of 2.5%. \\n\\n Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, stated that the U.S. debt ceiling, which has been suspended by Congress until the start of 2025, is expected to create a standoff and potentially trigger another sovereign credit rating downgrade, according to Reuters. \"The 5-year credit default swaps (CDS) on U.S. sovereign debt indicate some worry,” Goldberg said. \\n\\n Related: Why is Bitcoin price down today? \\n\\n The worsening sentiment was reinforced after retail data provider Syntun stated that China’s annual mid-year e-commerce festival saw sales drop for the first time in eight years. The event celebrates the founding date of Chinese giant JD.com which is the region’s second-largest in terms of annual sales, according to CNBC. Gross sales reached $102.3 billion in 2024, a 7% drop compared to 2023. \\n\\n Under this scenario, the U.S. dollar Strength Index (DXY) rose to its highest level in fifty days at 105.85, indicating that investors are moving away from the euro, British pound, Swiss franc, and similar currencies. While the S&P 500 index remained unchanged on June 21, traders viewed Bitcoin\\'s 52% gains year-to-date in 2024 as a reason to take profits and reduce exposure amid macroeconomic uncertainty. \\n\\n This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Dogwifhat (WIF) has not been the exception. The memecoin sensation of Q1 saw a significant price drop following the movements of a whale. Recently, an address transferred millions of WIF to a crypto exchange, which ignited speculation about who was behind the transaction. \\n\\n 6 Million WIF To Binance \\n\\n On Friday, reports of a massive WIF transfer to Binance hit the crypto community. Per the report, one of the top dogwifhat holders moved millions to the largest crypto exchange. \\n\\n The whale transferred 5.97 million WIF, worth around $11 million, on June 21. Additionally, the address offloaded 48 million Trump Coin (DJT), approximately $500,000. \\n\\n After the news, the crypto community began speculating who was behind the transfer. Some users claimed the whale was crypto trader Ansem, who was very vocal about WIF. The trader was also part of the Las Vegas Sphere project, where users donated around $700,000 to project the token’s image in the Sphere.  \\n\\n Users on X criticized Ansem for the alleged deposit, expressing their disappointment in his “capitulation”. Some investors took the opportunity to express their discontent with the trader for “grifting and dumping on investors.” \\n\\n The discussion sparked an important conversation: should Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) not move their money? One user considers that Ansem, and all KOLs, are free to do what they want with their money. The user argued that KOLs are subjected to criticism regardless of their route. \\n\\n When people sell before you do, they are “jeet”. When KOLs sell some of their holdings or even move it around, they are “pump and dampers”. \\n\\n Several community members agreed and questioned if KOLs are “obligated” to hold a token until investors are happy with their profits. However, others argue that community members are “arbiters” of traders’ reputations.  \\n\\n Dogwifhat Take A Blow, But Was It Ansem? \\n\\n Despite the rumors, online reports suggest the wallet is not linked to the crypto trader. After deep-diving into the address, a community member found that the address was not associated with Ansem. \\n\\n The post notes that the only reason it was linked to the trader was the large WIF balance and many Solana memecoins. \\n\\n However, the address has a record of selling their token at a loss “to FOMO into new shiny stuff.” Furthermore, the wallet seems to be linked to a now-deleted X account. At the time of writing, the trader has not acknowledged the rumors.  \\n\\n After the reports, WIF’s price dropped from the $1.90 to the $1.80 price range. On the last day, the memecoin plunged from the $2.15 mark, representing a 13% decrease. \\n\\n The token has also seen a 25.3% and 36.1% drop in the weekly and monthly timeframes. Crypto analyst Bluntz forecasted a bearish $1 target for the dog-themed memecoin.

Though the U.S. President has infrequently made public statements on crypto, that position may be changing as Election Day approaches.\\xa0 \\n\\n Since taking office, President Biden — for better or worse — may have helped push crypto further into the mainstream conversation for presidential politics. Weeks after his inauguration, he nominated Gary Gensler as chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In March 2022, he signed an executive order to establish a regulatory framework on digital assets. In 2024, the U.S. President announced and followed through with a veto of a resolution to overturn an SEC accounting rule on banks and crypto. \\n\\n Many U.S.-based crypto users also seemed to blame President Biden for lawmakers in his party voting against legislation and policies they considered positive for digital assets. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren has been one of the most vocal anti-crypto voices in Congress, often associating digital assets with the financing of terrorism and illicit activities.  \\n\\n Under Gensler, the SEC stepped up enforcement actions against crypto firms, and cases are pending against Ripple, Coinbase, Kraken, and others. Publicly, the SEC chair has maintained that a “come in and talk to us” was the best path crypto projects could take to legally offer their products and services in the United States. However, many companies have criticized the regulator for inconsistent enforcement of securities laws — most recently, with reports that the SEC considered labeling Ether ETHUSD a security. \\n\\n Trump’s sordid history on crypto \\n\\n In contrast, Trump moved from telling his Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, to “go after” Bitcoin (BTC) in 2018 while he was president to calling cryptocurrencies “not money” and “based on thin air” in 2019. After leaving office in January 2021, Trump said BTC seemed “like a scam,” and cryptocurrencies were “potentially a disaster waiting to happen.”Cointelegraph \\n\\n Only starting in December 2022 did Trump seem more willing to embrace digital assets, launching a non-fungible token (NFT) collection — just a few weeks after he announced his reelection bid for the U.S. presidency on Nov. 15,\\xa02022. After beating out other pro-crypto Republican candidates in 2023 and 2024, he announced his campaign would accept crypto and planned to have all remaining Bitcoin mined in the United States. \\n\\n President Biden softening on crypto? \\n\\n Trump’s mercurial position on crypto and other issues has many questioning whether his reelection would be a positive outcome for digital assets. Regardless of the former president’s true intentions, reports have suggested that President Biden may also be considering appealing to crypto voters by softening his position on digital asset legislation, accepting campaign donations in Bitcoin and influencing related policy at the SEC. \\n\\n After President Biden said he would veto an SEC rule on banks handling crypto, the White House issued a notice suggesting he would not do the same for the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act. Though the U.S. President opposed the digital asset legislation, he added that he was “eager to work with Congress” for an alternative bill to establish a regulatory framework for crypto. A House vote resulted in 71 Democratic lawmakers joining with a majority of Republicans to pass FIT21. \\n\\n “[T]he Biden Administration is shifting its tone on the digital asset sector,” said analysts at Pantera Capital in a June 18 letter. “[T]here have been reports of Biden’s re-election campaign reaching out to players in the blockchain space requesting guidance on crypto policy moving forward.” \\n\\n Moe Vela, a former adviser to then-Vice President Biden, told Cointelegraph that both Republican and Democratic candidates needed to “be very clear about where they stand in the future of the regulatory environment that they would create under their respective administrations.” He added that both candidates had “no choice” but to acknowledge the impact of the crypto industry, suggesting that donations in digital assets were one such step.  \\n\\n “I think it’s inevitable they must in my opinion,” said Vela on the Biden campaign accepting crypto. “It’s integral [for] both candidates if they want to appeal to the over 60 million U.S. investors in crypto, many of whom are disproportionately Gen Z and Millennial and young professionals — that is a huge swath of potential voters.” \\n\\n Cointelegraph reached out to President Biden’s reelection campaign for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication. \\n\\n Remember, remember the 5th of November \\n\\n President Biden and Trump have less than seven days to prepare for a June 27 presidential debate, in which they will face off against each other in person for the first time since 2020. They are also scheduled for a second debate on Sept. 10. Trump already has support from many in the crypto industry, including Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and executives from major mining firms.  \\n\\n Some in the space who suggest they plan to vote for President Biden tout the “nonpartisan” nature of crypto rather than his policies or cite Trump’s criminal conviction and legal troubles. Others outside the U.S. who are ineligible to vote still expressed concern about the ecosystem\\'s future in the United States.\\xa0 \\n\\n “I don’t like Bitcoin being aligned with one party but not the other,” Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of crypto investment platform Ledn, told Cointelegraph. \"You’re going to have an issue where the ones that are [pro-crypto] support it, build towards it, then it switches and then these guys undo all the work the pro-Bitcoin people did. The best case for us is to show both parties why America should have access to Bitcoin.” \\n\\n Election Day in the United States will be Nov. 5. Trump will be sentenced in New York on July 11, just a few days before the Republican National Convention nominates the party’s presidential candidate.\\xa0The former U.S. President has been found liable for sexual assault, convicted of 34 felony counts as part of efforts to cover up hush money payments to a porn star and found liable for fraud connected to his businesses. \\n\\n '}\n",

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that BTC dropped from an opening at $64,840 to an intra-day low of $63,451.\\xa0 \\n\\n The last time Bitcoin’s price traded below $64,000 was on May 15, when it rose from a low of $61,299 to set a swing high at $71,980 on May 21, fueled by excitement about a\\xa0spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval. \\n\\n At the time of publication, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $63,552, down 3.54% over the last 24 hours. Cointelegraph \\n\\n The broader crypto market capitalization is also down 3.24% over the same period to rest at $2.33 trillion, while Ether ETHUSD was down 2.25% to $3,475. \\n\\n Let’s look at some of the reasons why Bitcoin leads the market in a correction. \\n\\n Bleeding spot Bitcoin ETFs weigh on BTC price \\n\\n Investors’ risk-off sentiment is evident across the spot Bitcoin ETFs, where investors\\xa0have been withdrawing their capital\\xa0for days. \\n\\n On June 19, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded outflows for the fifth consecutive day, bringing the total withdrawals for the week to $900 million. This is the highest outflow activity since late April.  \\n\\n According to data from the crypto research platform SoSoValue, the 10 listed ETFs lost approximately $140 million on June 20. Cointelegraph \\n\\n Grayscale’s GBTC, which has mostly seen outflows since its conversion to an ETF on Jan. 10, led with $53.1 million outflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at $51.1 million. VanEck’s ETF reported $4 million in net outflows, while the funds from Invesco and Galaxy Digital saw $2 million in net outflows.  \\n\\n BlackRock’s IBIT, the biggest ETF by assets held, was the only product with net inflows totaling $1.5 million. Other funds from ARK Invest, Valkyrie, Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree and Hashdex recorded zero flows. \\n\\n The total trading volume for the spot Bitcoin ETFs on June 20 amounted to $1.16 billion, down from $1.7 billion on June 18. The market was closed on June 19 for a public holiday. \\n\\n Falling network activity backs Bitcoin’s downside \\n\\n Another reason why Bitcoin’s price continues to scale downward could be reduced demand due to declining network activity.  \\n\\n Data from Glassnode reveals that daily active addresses on the Bitcoin network have dropped from 971,789 addresses on April 4 to 632,620 on June 20. This marks a 35% decrease over the last 90 days.Cointelegraph \\n\\n Popular analyst Ali Martinez also observed the reduced activity on the Bitcoin blockchain. In a June 21 post on the X social network, he shared a Glassnode chart showing that Bitcoin exchange inflow volume has been on a downward trend over the last three months. \\n\\n Cointelegraph \\n\\n Decreasing onchain activity suggests a waning demand for BTC within the ecosystem, which weighs down on its price. \\n\\n Bitcoin’s price loses key support levels \\n\\n From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s price decline today is part of a broader correction that started after it was rejected from the $72,000 resistance level on June 7. During this drawdown, BTC has lost key support levels, including the 50- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), which are currently at $66,724 and $66,594, respectively. \\n\\n The 200-day EMA ($64,294) provided the last line of defense for Bitcoin. Cointelegraph \\n\\n At the time of publication, BTC’s price was breaching the support provided by the 200-day EMA, accompanied by a 15% rise in daily trading volumes, signaling the activation of the continuation of the sell-off.  \\n\\n On the downside, the key levels to watch at $60,000 and the $56,500 swing low. \\n\\n This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

According to Willy Woo, the key to understanding when Bitcoin might start its recovery lies in observing miner capitulation and the subsequent recovery of the hash rate. \\n\\n Miner capitulation occurs when less efficient miners, unable to sustain profitability, are forced to sell their holdings and exit the market. This phase is critical as it typically decreases selling pressure, allowing for market consolidation and setting the stage for potential price increases. \\n\\n Woo points out that this cycle is not a quick one. Historical data from previous Halving events, which reduce the reward for mining Bitcoin, show that recovery can take time. \\n\\n I’ll break it down in simple terms. \\n\\n When does #Bitcoin recover? It’s when weak miners die and hash rate recovers. \\n\\n This one is for the record books as it’s taking a lot of time for miner capitulation post-halving. \\n\\n Probably can thank ordinal inscriptions boosting profits. pic.twitter.com/19MB0b8mHO \\n\\n The current cycle appears prolonged, with miners taking longer than usual to capitulate due to the profitability provided by new market mechanisms like ordinal inscriptions. This extended adjustment period might be difficult for investors, but it is a necessary step toward achieving a healthier market. \\n\\n Key Indicators to Watch: Hash Ribbons and Market Signals \\n\\n Willy Woo emphasizes the importance of monitoring Bitcoin’s hash ribbons. This indicator provides insights into the economic viability of Bitcoin mining. \\n\\n A reduction in hash ribbons suggests that the cost of mining is becoming more aligned with the market price of Bitcoin, signaling that the worst of the sell-off may be over and a recovery could be forthcoming. In addition to hash ribbons, Woo advises investors to keep an eye on broader market signals. \\n\\n Here’s a view of just how much paper bets on #Bitcoin there is right now. \\n\\n The solid yellow chart is a z-score oscillator looking at how significant it is locally. \\n\\n We need a solid amount of liquidations still before we get the all clear for further bullish activity. https://t.co/tswxQwxlc1 pic.twitter.com/TwGG5tf50z \\n\\n For instance, the current speculative environment in Bitcoin, marked by a high volume of theoretical trading, requires a series of liquidations to achieve market balance. This clean-up phase, although painful, is essential for setting a solid foundation for the next bull run. \\n\\n The analyst noted: \\n\\n I know it sucks, but BTC is not going to break all time highs until more pain and boredom plays out. On the bright side, miners are capitulating and when that is through, it nearly always ends in a huge rally. Look for compressions in this ribbon. Buy and hodl in these regions. \\n\\n Featured image from DALL-E, Chart from TradingView \\n\\n '}\n",

It also highlights the strategic importance of financial institutions equipped with blockchain capabilities. \\n\\n Democratizing Investments: How Tokenization Opens Doors for Small Investors\\xa0 \\n\\n McKinsey’s analysis suggests asset tokenization will occur in waves. The initial wave will focus on asset classes with proven returns on investment and scalability. \\n\\n These include cash and deposits, bonds and exchange-traded notes (ETNs), mutual funds, and securitizations. By 2030, the total tokenized market capitalization could reach approximately $2 trillion, driven primarily by these asset classes. \\n\\n “The pessimistic and optimistic scenarios range from about $1 trillion to about $4 trillion, respectively,” McKinsey analysts added. \\n\\n This figure contrasts with the September 2022 projection by ADDX and BCG, which estimated the global market for illiquid asset tokenization could reach $16 trillion by 2030. These differing projections highlight varying perspectives on the speed and scale of tokenization adoption. \\n\\n Furthermore, the report pointed out that one of the most compelling aspects of tokenization is its potential to democratize access to traditionally exclusive investments. By lowering the minimum investment sizes, tokenization enables a broader range of investors to participate in high-value assets. \\n\\n This democratization is evident in regions like Thailand and the Philippines. The issuance of tokenized bonds in those areas has enabled small-ticket investors to engage through fractional ownership. \\n\\n Repurchase agreements, or “repos,” are also a successful use case for tokenization. Financial institutions like Goldman Sachs currently transact trillions of dollars of monthly repo volume using tokenized platforms. \\n\\n “On the operational side, smart-contract-enabled execution automates daily life cycle management (for example, collateral valuation and margin top-ups). It reduces errors and settlement failures and simplifies reporting; 24/7 instant settlement and on-chain data also improve capital efficiency through intraday liquidity for short-term borrowing and enhanced collateral usage,” McKinsey analysts elaborated. \\n\\n Overcoming Regulatory and “Cold Start” Challenges \\n\\n Despite the clear benefits and growing momentum, the report acknowledges that widespread adoption of tokenization faces several challenges, including regulatory hurdles. One major challenge is the complexity of modernizing existing infrastructure in a regulation-heavy industry. \\n\\n “In many jurisdictions, the regulatory and legal certainty to engage with any form of digital assets is lacking, and critical enablers, such as widespread availability of wholesale tokenized cash and deposits for settlement, have yet to be supplied,” the report outlined. \\n\\n In addition to regulatory challenges, McKinsey’s report emphasizes the importance of overcoming the “cold start” problem to achieve true scale in tokenization. This challenge arises from the need for network effects, where investors capture real value from cost savings, higher liquidity, or enhanced compliance. \\n\\n However, the report introduces the concept of minimum viable value chains (MVVCs) to solve the cold start problem. MVVCs collaborate with financial institutions and other stakeholders to create interconnected infrastructures supporting tokenized assets. Examples include the blockchain-based repo ecosystems operated by Broadridge and JPMorgan’s Onyx platform in collaboration with Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon. \\n\\n '}\n",

He emphasized that all class action claims were dismissed, reiterating that this outcome does not alter the standing of XRP as not being a security, in line with a prior New York court decision. \\n\\n “As many have noticed – and some have already pointed out – there have been numerous misleading and some factually inaccurate headlines describing the decision made by a California judge yesterday in the class action lawsuit about XRP. This is a big win – all class action claims in the suit were DISMISSED, and absolutely nothing in the decision negates or changes the fact that XRP is, in and of itself, not a security,” Garlinghouse stated. \\n\\n He further clarified that the remaining state law claim, now scheduled for trial, involves a plaintiff who did not purchase XRP directly from Ripple and cannot confirm if he even encountered the disputed statements before his transaction. Furthermore, Garlinghouse criticized the plaintiffs, labeling them as opportunists attempting to exploit the legal system for substantial settlements. \\n\\n Amid this legal backdrop, crypto analyst Woo Min-Kyu observed a notable increase in open interest (OI) for XRP, surpassing other cryptocurrencies. This trend suggests that as open interest rises alongside price, more investors are opening positions with the expectation of XRP’s price increase. \\n\\n Min-Kyu emphasized that this heightened interest indicates increased trading activity. However, he also warned of potential market volatility, advising investors to prioritize risk management. As open interest and price rise, the market may experience sudden fluctuations, necessitating careful monitoring. \\n\\n “This trend suggests that as open interest rises alongside price, investors are opening more positions with the expectation of XRP’s price increase. This heightened interest indicates that more trading activity is occurring with XRP,” Min-Kyu said. \\n\\n The growing investor interest in XRP reflects the market’s response to these legal developments and the optimistic outlook for its value as Brad Garlinghouse defends Ripple’s position and anticipates further clarity during the upcoming trial. \\n\\n '}\n",

It invites them to participate in the Pantera “TON Investment Opportunity” by June 21, with a minimum commitment of $250,000 per investor. \\n\\n This move comes after Pantera’s largest-ever investment in TON, which was executed in March at a significant discount. The firm’s decision to double down on Toncoin reflects its bullish stance on the token’s potential growth. \\n\\n Likewise, crypto analyst Marteen believes The Open Network has seen impressive growth, with several key metrics highlighting its increasing popularity. \\n\\n For instance, the TON transfer volume, ranging between $5 billion and $10 billion, indicates that the network has achieved about 10% of Bitcoin’s capacity, a remarkable feat for a four-year-old cryptocurrency. Furthermore, the number of on-chain TON holders has surged from 2.9 million to 32 million over the past year. \\n\\n “On-chain metrics of TON are going parabolic!… Currently, there are 32 million holders, up from 2.9 million a year ago. This represents a 10x increase in just one year, underscoring the growing popularity of the TON-Token,” Marteen wrote. \\n\\n Despite these promising developments, some analysts debate the long-term sustainability of TON’s growth compared to Ethereum’s established ecosystem and scaling solutions.

Glassnode lead analyst James Check cautioned traders in a June 19 X post not to fall prey to a “combination of boredom, mini-pumps and mini-dumps” and get shaken out of their positions. \\n\\n While the near-term Bitcoin price action remains uncertain, analysts are bullish about the long-term prospects. Analysts at research and brokerage firm Bernstein expect strong flows into spot United States Bitcoin exchange-traded funds to boost Bitcoin’s price to $200,000 by the end of the next year, an upward revision from their previous target of $150,000.Cointelegraph \\n\\n Some analysts expect a correction in the near term but that has not prevented MicroStrategy from adding more Bitcoin to its stockpile. The firm announced on June 20 that it had purchased 11,931 Bitcoin at an average price of $65,883 per Bitcoin, taking its total to 226,331 Bitcoin. The recently completed $800 million convertible note offering funded the latest purchase. \\n\\n Could Bitcoin stage a strong recovery in the next few days and pull the cryptocurrency markets higher? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. \\n\\n Bitcoin price analysis \\n\\n Bitcoin attempted a recovery on June 20, but the long wick on the candlestick shows strong selling by the bears near the moving averages. Cointelegraph \\n\\n The bears pulled the price below the solid support at $64,602 on June 21, indicating the start of a deeper pullback. If bears sustain the price below $64,602, the selling could pick up, and the BTCUSDT pair may descend to the next significant support at $60,000. \\n\\n Instead, if the price turns up and closes above $64,602, it will signal aggressive buying at lower levels. The pair may climb to the 20-day exponential moving average ($66,736), which is likely to act as a strong resistance. Buyers will have to overcome this barrier to clear the path for a rally to $70,000 and subsequently to $72,000. \\n\\n Ether price analysis \\n\\n Buyers tried to push Ether (ETH) above the 20-day EMA ($3,575) on June 20, but the bears held their ground. This suggests that bears remain sellers on relief rallies.Cointelegraph \\n\\n The bears will try to strengthen their position further by pulling and maintaining the price below the 50-day simple moving average ($3,458). If they manage to do that, the selling could accelerate, and the pair may dive to $3,000. \\n\\n If bulls want to prevent the down move, they will have to quickly push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. The ETHUSDT pair could then attempt a rally to $3,730 and later to $3,977. \\n\\n BNB price analysis \\n\\n BNB (BNB) has been trading below the moving averages for the past few days, indicating that the bears are maintaining their pressure.Cointelegraph \\n\\n The first support on the downside is $560. If the price rebounds off this level, it will signal that the BNBUSDT pair may remain between $560 and $635 for a while. A break above $635 will suggest that the bulls are back in the game. \\n\\n On the contrary, if the price breaks below $560, the correction may deepen, and the pair could plunge to $536 and eventually to $495. The bulls are expected to fiercely defend this level. \\n\\n Solana price analysis \\n\\n The bears thwarted efforts by the bulls to push Solana (SOL) back inside the descending channel pattern in the past two days.Cointelegraph \\n\\n This suggests that the bears have flipped the support line into resistance. A break below $128 could sink the SOLUSDT pair to the solid support at $116. Buyers are expected to defend this level with vigor. \\n\\n The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-day EMA ($148). The bulls will have to push the price above the resistance line to open the doors for a rally to $176 and then $188. \\n\\n XRP price analysis \\n\\n XRP (XRP) has been trading between the 50-day SMA ($0.51) and the vital support at $0.46 for several days. Cointelegraph \\n\\n A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they are trying to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.50). If they manage to do that, the possibility of a break above the 50-day SMA increases. The XRPUSDT pair could then rally to $0.57. \\n\\n The critical level to watch on the downside is $0.46. If this level gives way, the pair may tumble to the pivotal level of $0.41. The bulls are expected to buy in the zone between $0.46 and $0.41. \\n\\n Dogecoin price analysis \\n\\n The bulls have held Dogecoin (DOGE) above the crucial support of $0.12 for the past three days but they failed to start a strong rebound.Cointelegraph \\n\\n The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.14) and the RSI near the oversold zone suggest that the bears are in command. If the $0.12 support breaks down, the DOGEUSDT pair could start declining to $0.08. \\n\\n This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the 20-day EMA. That will suggest the consolidation to continue for a few more days. \\n\\n Toncoin price analysis \\n\\n Toncoin (TON) is attempting a rebound off the 50-day SMA ($6.76), signaling that the bulls are aggressively defending the level.Cointelegraph \\n\\n If buyers shove the price above the 20-day EMA ($7.23), it will suggest the start of a relief rally to $7.67. This level may again attract selling by the bears, but if the bulls overcome this resistance, the TONUSDT pair may rise to $8.29. \\n\\n The critical level to watch on the downside is the 50-day SMA. A break and close below this support will suggest the start of a deeper correction. The pair may slump to $6, and after that, to $5.50. \\n\\n Cardano price analysis \\n\\n Cardano (ADA) has been trading in a tight range near the breakdown level of $0.40 for the past few days. Cointelegraph \\n\\n If the price breaks above $0.40, it is again likely to face selling at the moving averages. However, if the bulls prevail, it will suggest the start of a robust recovery. The ADAUSDT pair could rise to $0.50, where the bears may pose a strong challenge. \\n\\n Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from $0.40 or the moving averages and breaks below $0.35, it will indicate that the bears hold the edge. The pair may then plunge to $0.28. \\n\\n Shiba Inu price analysis \\n\\n The bulls are protecting the $0.000017 level in Shiba Inu (SHIB) but have failed to start a strong rebound. This suggests a lack of aggressive buying at current levels.Cointelegraph \\n\\n The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.000021) and the RSI in the oversold zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If the $0.000017 level cracks, the SHIBUSDT pair may plummet to $0.000014. \\n\\n If bulls want to prevent the downside, they will have to swiftly drive the price above the 20-day EMA. If they do that, it will suggest that the markets have rejected the breakdown. The up move may pick up pace above the 50-day SMA ($0.000023). \\n\\n Avalanche price analysis \\n\\n The bulls are attempting a recovery in Avalanche (AVAX), which is facing selling at the breakdown level of $29.Cointelegraph \\n\\n If the price turns down from $29, it will signal that the bears have flipped the level into resistance. That will increase the possibility of a drop below $25. If that happens, the AVAXUSDT pair could slide to $20. \\n\\n Buyers will have to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($30.95) to weaken the selling pressure. The pair may then climb to the 50-day SMA ($34.39), suggesting that the breakdown below $29 could have been a bear trap. \\n\\n This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

            "{'id': 'newsbtc:95a1f6d9a094b:0', 'title': 'XRP Exhibiting Unusual On-Chain Behavior, How Will This Affect Price?', 'time': 'Fri, 21 Jun 2024 17:00:53 GMT', 'source': 'NewsBTC', 'description': 'Data shows XRP is currently exhibiting an interesting on-chain behavior amidst a broader market uncertainty. This unusual behavior was highlighted by CryptoQuant, a crypto on-chain analytics company. The peculiar behavior is noteworthy because it is associated with a growing open interest in XRP in comparison to other cryptocurrencies, suggesting XRP is primed for a major price move. \\n\\n XRP Open Interest Surges \\n\\n According to CryptoQuant data initially noted by an analyst associated with the analytics platform, recent news involving the SEC and Ripple, XRP’s parent company, has seen the open interest for XRP resuming an uptrend. \\n\\n As per the CryptoQuant chart below, the open interest, which has generally been in an uptrend since April 15, recently took a hit in the first week of June and started to decline concurrently with a fall in the price of XRP. However, the open interest has now rebounded and has resumed its uptrend.\\xa0 \\n\\n Interestingly, this increase is more significant than that of other cryptocurrencies, considering many crypto prices have struggled in the past week. The rising open interest also relays the current sentiment among XRP investors, as it indicates that investors are opening more positions in anticipation of an increase in the price of XRP. \\n\\n How Will This Affect Price? \\n\\n Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that haven’t been settled. Climbing open interest often signals more money flowing into the market. This is evident in the chart above, as increases in open interest have mostly been registered with a corresponding increase in the price of XRP. \\n\\n Furthermore, open interest is considered a leading indicator for many savvy investors. When it soars, it signals that new money is flowing into the market as traders open new positions. This increased activity and liquidity can foreshadow where an asset’s price might be headed next. Regardless of the direction in which the price heads, one outcome is nearly guaranteed: more volatility. \\n\\n At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.486 and has increased by 1.44% in the past seven days. Despite this meager increase, it’s interesting to note that XRP is currently the only asset among the top 20 largest cryptocurrencies still in the green zone in the past week. Adding to the bullish outlook is the strong trading volume over the past few days. \\n\\n According to data from Santiment, some traders are still bearish on XRP despite the fact that it is currently outperforming many other assets. XRP is also traders shorting to counter the bulls. However, as Santiment noted, this is a good sign for patient bulls, as the shorting activity can act as ‘rocket fuel’ for continued price rises when they eventually become liquidated. \\n\\n '}\n",

The chances of this happening are rather high, which makes ARB holders’ behavior rather surprising. Instead of being negative, their sentiment seems to be the opposite for now. \\n\\n Weighted sentiment measures the overall market mood by factoring in the volume and intensity of positive and negative sentiments. It also considers the asset’s social media mentions to provide an optimal analysis of the sentiment. \\n\\n For the first time in three months, this sentiment is positive for Arbitrum. As investors’ optimism rises, the price could, too. \\n\\n In addition to this, the broader market cues are flashing a buy signal at the moment. This can be seen in the Price Daily Active Addresses (DAA) divergence. This metric compares the price movement of an asset with the activity level of unique addresses interacting with it.\\xa0 \\n\\n A divergence occurs when the price trends in one direction while the daily active addresses trend in another, indicating potential market shifts. Currently, participation is rising, and the price is decreasing. \\n\\n Such an instance is usually a bullish signal and accumulation at this point translates to gains. \\n\\n ARB Price Prediction: No Room for Error \\n\\n Arbitrum’s price has a chance to benefit from the optimism surrounding the asset. Should ARB holders continue their accumulation, the altcoin could prevent falling to $0.74 and lower. This price marks the current all-time low for ARB, which was established in September of last year. \\n\\n However, considering the investors are looking bullish, the price could jump to reclaim $0.92 as a support line. This would enable recovery to $1 and above. \\n\\n Nevertheless, even the slightest drawdown would mark the first ATL in nine months. If investors add to this bearishness by selling to offset losses, Arbitrum’s price could dip to $0.60 or lower. \\n\\n '}\n",

Project founders also say the game has over 10 million active players, including one reporter for The Block.\\xa0 \\n\\n Telegram-based games have taken the world by storm since the launch of NOTcoin (and other derivative projects) on the TON blockchain. These “tap to earn” games are simple to play and offer users the possibility of airdropped tokens.\\xa0 \\n\\n “Following Notcoin, the TON blockchain ecosystem has seen the emergence of numerous Tap-to-Earn robot platforms, attracting significant Web2 user traffic,” representatives for Pluto Studios, the founders of Catizen, said in a sponsored blog post.\\xa0 \\n\\n Like other “tap-to-earn” games growing in popularity on Telegram, Catizen offers players a chance to reap rewards by touching buttons on a screen. The primary game is a type of roulette wheel that users spin to determine what types of rewards will be granted.\\xa0 \\n\\n Users can either win a “Meow Box,” “Super Box,” or points, each of which will contribute to their holdings, which could conceivably be redeemed for a cryptocurrency called $MNT via the ByBit exchange once they reach an equivalent amount of in-game points as one U.S. dollar.\\xa0 \\n\\n To enter the game, players must navigate to the official Catizen Telegram bot. Once there, they can view game instructions, engage with the community or click “Play” to begin. Clicking “Play” will launch the game, enabling players to begin earning in-game tokens. Each tap will increase their total balance.\\xa0 \\n\\n Aesthetically, the game looks a cross between Pokemon and Hello Kitty. The background music is repetitive but jazzy.\\xa0 \\n\\n One reporter from The Block was able to earn 99 cents worth of in-game points before running out of spins. To gain more chances at the wheel of fortune, users must invite their contacts on Telegram to play, unless they are willing to pay to play.\\xa0 \\n\\n Catizen offers both a free and paid version and claims a user base of over 50% paid users. Free users cannot always play the game and must wait for “seats” to open up. Users can also join “clubs” that could potentially place them in a league with the top-ranked players. \\n\\n Game developers plan to expand into a full-fledged “mini-game platform” and reportedly “have signed agreements for 18 mini-games with over 50 million downloads, including the blockbuster game Hero Wars with over 100 million downloads.” \\n\\n A YouTube video advertising the app also shows a Neopets-like game where players can care for cats, which was not accessible using the unpaid version of Catizen.\\xa0 \\n\\n A review of the project’s X (formerly Twitter) page suggests that many of the game’s users are based in Russia, which is often the case for Telegram-based games. \\n\\n Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

            "{'id': 'the_block:e0fcfd9ff094b:0', 'title': 'Pantera Capital is raising funds for second TON token investment', 'time': 'Fri, 21 Jun 2024 16:26:28 GMT', 'source': 'The Block', 'description': 'Crypto venture capital firm Pantera is raising money for a new fund to invest specifically in The Open Network\\'s Toncoin (TON), doubling down on its prior bet on the token. \\n\\n Dubbed the \"Pantera TON Investment Opportunity,\" the fund aims to raise capital to buy more TON tokens, according to an email seen by The Block that Pantera sent to potential investors earlier this week. \"We are inviting you to participate in the upcoming round of this investment opportunity,\" the email reads. \\n\\n Interested parties have been requested to indicate their interest in the opportunity through a form by June 21 to secure an allocation in the fund. The form notes that the minimum investment per backer is $250,000. \\n\\n Pantera declined to comment to The Block when contacted. \\n\\n Pantera is betting big on TON \\n\\n Pantera\\'s new TON fund comes shortly after the firm made its largest-ever investment in TON since its founding in 2003. At the time, Pantera did not disclose any deal terms, but the email seen by The Block notes that the investment was made in the TON token \"at a significant discount to the spot price\" in March. Pantera officially announced the investment in May. \\n\\n With the latest TON fund effort, Pantera appears to be highly bullish about the token\\'s potential. \"We believe the TON network is still in its early stages, and we are excited to witness the adoption of its ecosystem and new features by the Telegram user base,\" Ryan Barney, a Pantera partner, said last month. \\n\\n The TON blockchain, formerly known as the Telegram Open Network, was initially launched by Telegram. However, the company withdrew from the project after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission claimed in 2019 that Telegram\\'s sale of tokens called \"Grams\" violated federal securities laws. In 2020, Telegram and its subsidiary TON Issuer Inc. agreed to return over $1.2 billion to investors and pay an $18.5 million civil penalty. \\n\\n The open-source community then continued to develop the TON blockchain independently, but Telegram has continued to support the network. Earlier this year, the messaging giant introduced an ad revenue-sharing system for channel owners that will pay out exclusively in the TON token and feature a 50/50 revenue split between the platform and channel operators. \\n\\n TON blockchain growth surges \\n\\n The number of TON blockchain users and transactions has been growing rapidly lately.\\xa0Tether\\'s USDT stablecoin also launched on the TON network in April. USDT\\'s adoption on the network has been faster than any prior blockchain, with over 400 million USDT in circulation in under two months, Pantera said in the email. \\n\\n Telegram gaming mini-apps have also experienced remarkable growth, outpacing all previous crypto games, Pantera said in the email. The firm compared Notcoin and Hamster Kombat with Axie Infinity and said that Notcoin reached 35 million players and around 10 million daily active users within five months of its launch, while Hamster Kombat has reached 100 million players and between 40 and 45 million daily active users. However, those numbers could include bots. \\n\\n Overall, given the recent traction on the TON network, the TON token has grown to become the tenth largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of over $17.5 billion, according to The Block\\'s Toncoin Price Page. One TON is currently trading at around $7. \\n\\n As for Pantera, the venture capital firm with nearly $5 billion in assets under management, is currently also raising a $1 billion new crypto Fund V to invest in venture equity, early-stage tokens, special opportunities and liquid tokens.  \\n\\n Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

The company acquired 11,931 BTC worth $786 million, with the average price per coin constituting $65,883. Currently, the company owns a total of 226,331 BTC, making it the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. The funding for the purchase was provided by MicroStrategy\\'s recent debt sale. Prior to that, the company announced that it had completed its $800 million convertible note offering. However, the acquisition, despite its massive size, did not have much of an effect on the market, as it was mostly priced in after MicroStrategy upsized its debt sale last week. \\n\\n Shiba Inu team lead unveils unexpected SHIB game \\n\\n In a recent\\xa0X post, Lucie, marketing lead at the Shiba Inu project,\\xa0revealed what to expect from a Shibarium game that is currently in its late developmental stages, citing the words of Shiba Inu lead Shytoshi Kusama. According to Kusama, the completed game will be licensed solely to the decentralized team at Shiba Inu for use on Shibarium. Later on, the mobile version could be enhanced via the addition of relatable decentralized elements. The Shiba Inu lead hopes that the game will provide value to the ecosystem’s core tokens, SHIB, LEASH and BONE. Also, Kusama confirmed that revenue from in-app game purchases will incentivize SHIB and LEASH burns. \\n\\n XRP, ADA: Good sign for potential bulls, \"rocket fuel\" could be here: Report \\n\\n A recent Santiment\\xa0report brought\\xa0good news to the XRP and ADA communities.

And let\\'s be real, who among us hasn\\'t felt like Cookie Monster when eyeing those tempting crypto gains? The crypto community\\'s meme coin lords and degens possibly exhibit the same tendencies that Cookie Monster has been associated with. \\n\\n Now, this little X exchange doesn\\'t mean Dell\\'s about to go all-in on Bitcoin like Saylor (who\\'s sitting on a cool 226,331 BTC worth $15 billion). But it\\'s got folks wondering: is the tech billionaire getting the crypto itch? Maybe, just maybe. \\n\\n Let\\'s chew on that Cookie Monster symbolism for a sec. On one hand, it could represent the voracious appetite some have for acquiring Bitcoin – you know, that \"must have more\" feeling. \\n\\n But there\\'s a flip side, too. Cookie Monster has evolved over the years to symbolize the opposite of what the character was known for — to teach kids about moderation and self-control. So perhaps Dell is hinting at a more measured approach to crypto. Or heck, maybe he just thought it was a funny meme. After all, even billionaires aren\\'t immune to the allure of internet humor. \\n\\n While Dell Technologies is sitting comfortably with $34.6 billion in current assets (including a not-too-shabby $5.8 billion in cash), there\\'s no mention of Bitcoin anywhere in their recent filings. So, for now, this looks more like a playful flirtation than a full-on pursuit of Bitcoin and crypto more broadly. \\n\\n Today it\\'s a Cookie Monster meme, tomorrow it could be... well, who knows?

This decentralized, non-custodial bridge connects Bitcoin to IBC-enabled chains like Osmosis. The Nomic Bitcoin Bridge introduces an nBTC native token within the Cosmos ecosystem, which can be transferred over IBC protocols and utilized throughout Cosmos. \\n\\n “Nomic offers a decentralized, non-custodial Bitcoin bridge to IBC-enabled chains like Osmosis. nBTC, the Bitcoin-backed asset provided by Nomic, is live on Osmosis today, along with Interchain Deposits. This feature allows Osmosis users to deposit BTC directly within the Osmosis app to receive nBTC,” reads the proposal. \\n\\n With this, the DAO, which governs the Cosmos-based decentralized exchange (DEX) and appchain Osmosis, is holding an ongoing vote for\\xa0Proposal 795. \\n\\n The proposal outlines a Protocol Revenue sharing agreement and looks to replace bridging costs with a share on taker fees. Specifically, part of the taker fees generated by trading nBTC or its derivatives on the DAO will be shared with Nomic.\\xa0This\\xa0is as opposed to\\xa0arbitrage trading\\xa0against the value of native BTC. \\n\\n Arbitrage trading is one of the most known outcomes of an imperfect, inefficient market model. It benefits those using price differences on identical financial instruments on different platforms. \\n\\n Implications Of The Vote Passing \\n\\n The proposal is likely to pass, with 91.88% of votes in favor amid a 47.44% voter turnout. If approved, the DAO will waive Bitcoin bridging fees for transactions originating or terminating on Osmosis. \\n\\n At the same time, the Nomic blockchain will realize increased nBTC token adoption across Osmosis-based applications. \\n\\n For Osmosis users, this lot will enjoy a low-cost decentralized bridge to Bitcoin, which will also increase BTC liquidity in the Osmosis ecosystem. As it stands, there is no other decentralized means to bring BTC to Osmosis. \\n\\n “This proposal, if passed, is a significant milestone in DAO-to-DAO deals. It provides a new ‘rev share’ business model for bridges, one that is uniquely possible with appchains,” Osmosis co-founder Sunny Aggarwal\\xa0wrote\\xa0in the Osmosis forum. \\n\\n Notably, Osmosis and Nomic Governance will determine how much nBTC taker fees go to their blockchains. Once the two chains become active, the proposal will remain valid for the first six months before it is due for re-evaluation. \\n\\n If both blockchain governances approve the mechanism, it will be implemented during a future software upgrade. However, it’s acceptable that one chain approves it first, in which case they will liaise to ensure that the start date of both mechanisms is synchronized. \\n\\n '}\n",

He explained that although Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs and meme coins are trending, altcoins have significantly underperformed. \\n\\n “Most retail doesn’t hold large amounts of Bitcoin – they’re in altcoins. And altcoins have been significantly underperforming thus far this cycle,” he noted. \\n\\n Deutscher highlighted several critical data points: \\n\\n Deutscher attributed the market’s behavior to a Bitcoin-led cycle driven by the spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) narrative and strong inflows. \\n\\n “This has been a Bitcoin-narrative led cycle… Specific narratives have significantly outperformed (with majors lagging). Memes, AI, and RWA have been the clear leaders so far this cycle,” he added. \\n\\n Altcoin Season Is Coming Soon \\n\\n Despite the current scenario, crypto investor Layah Heilpern pointed to several bullish factors for crypto, including Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals and endorsements from high-profile figures. She argued that the market has shaken out weak hands and is poised for the next big move. \\n\\n “Imagine not being bullish on crypto right now. The Winklevoss twins donated $2 million to Donald Trump. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs approved. Trump endorsed crypto. The halving is done. Ethereum is not a security,” Heilpern said. \\n\\n Meanwhile, Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, and technical analyst Mister Crypto are seeing signs of an early altcoin season. Ju observed that Ethereum’s MVRV ratio is rising faster than Bitcoin’s, indicating that Ethereum is heating up relative to its on-chain fundamentals. \\n\\n This could suggest an Ethereum-led altcoin season, especially given the current ETF situation. \\n\\n “Given the current ETF situation, this might be an ETH-only season. Historically, when ETH surges, other alts tend to follow,” Ju wrote. \\n\\n Given the potential for an altcoins season, Michaël van de Poppe explained he is bullish on Chainlink LINKUSD, citing historical patterns and expecting a significant rally in the second half of the year. He noted that LINK has formed a solid weekly candle on its cycle low, similar to patterns seen in previous years that led to substantial gains. \\n\\n “LINK makes a very decent weekly candle on the cycle low… A similar price pattern occurred in previous years, resulting in a 150% rally. I’m expecting the same,” van de Poppe said. \\n\\n Meanwhile, Rekt Finance highlighted Polkadot’s entry into the AI race as a bullish indicator. With projects like OriginTrail and PhalaNetwork leveraging Polkadot’s technology for AI, Polkadot could become a central hub for AI projects, potentially boosting its value. \\n\\n While analysts diverge on the exact timing, the consensus remains that altcoin season is on the horizon. Investors should stay informed and consider market trends and expert insights. \\n\\n '}\n",

ADA is mirroring a broader market sell-off, which saw Bitcoin slump to a more than one-month low, and the crypto market rally is showing signs of fatigue in the absence of fresh market catalysts. ADA fell to a low of $0.366 on June 18 and is still down 8.76% weekly. Global In/Out of the Money, Courtesy: IntoTheBlock \\n\\n According to data from IntoTheBlock, a notable 2.35 billion ADA were acquired by 159,400 addresses within Cardano's current range of $0.38 to $0.394, averaging out to $0.387 per ADA. This accumulation marks a key support zone for the ADA price. \\n\\n What's next for ADA price? \\n\\n The present trading range, where substantial buying activity occurred, highlights a critical support level. If the Cardano price declines further, market watchers and ADA holders might look to the next anticipated support zone, which lies between $0.373 and $0.38. This range could provide a safety net for the cryptocurrency, potentially curbing further declines. \\n\\n On the flip side, if ADA's price rebounds from its current levels, it may face its next significant resistance between $0.394 and $0.437. Within this upper range, 2.64 billion ADA were bought by 206,880 addresses, with an average price of $0.414. This area could present a formidable challenge for upward momentum, requiring strong buying pressure to break through. \\n\\n Currently, on-chain data suggests that the ADA price might be reaching a crucial juncture.

The SEC\\'s Chair, Gary Gensler, has not explicitly stated that ether is a security. Meanwhile, at the SEC\\'s sister agency, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam has asserted that ether is a commodity. \\n\\n The SEC\\'s move to close its investigation does tip the scales into ether being treated as a commodity, said Teresa Goody Guillén, a partner at BakerHostetler law firm and former litigation counsel for the SEC, in an email. \\n\\n \"The SEC reportedly closing its investigation into ether does not mean that this Commission is definitely concluding that ether is not a security,\" she said. \"But it does provide another data point that this Commission has concluded not to bring an action alleging that ether is a security at this time.\" \\n\\n A former SEC enforcement attorney who asked not to be named said the SEC could have decided to throw out the investigation either because it has decided that ether is not a security or because it was too much of a litigation risk for the agency to take.\\xa0 \\n\\n The lawyer said in an interview with The Block that the SEC could also decide to hedge future statements on whether ether is a security.  \\n\\n \"It\\'s possible that they\\'ll come out and say, well, you know Consensys\\' issuance of eth is not a securities transaction, but it\\'s possible in some other formation eth could be issued as a security, or maybe they\\'ll make some more definitive statement,\" the former SEC attorney said. \"I think the important thing to remember is that I don\\'t think closing this case necessarily means that they have decided that there is no security here. It just could be that they\\'ve decided they don\\'t want to risk litigating it.\"\\xa0 \\n\\n Next steps \\n\\n Consensys has said it still plans to pursue its lawsuit against the SEC. The firm sued the agency in April over its approach to regulating Ethereum and said at the time that the SEC \"trained its sights\" on the firm\\'s MetaMask software. In the complaint, the firm also said it received a Wells notice, meaning a formal notice that the agency plans to bring an enforcement action against them.\\xa0 \\n\\n The firm is seeking relief for MetaMask and for the SEC to say that Consensys is not acting as a broker-dealer or participating in the sale of securities through its MetaMask Swaps and MetaMask Staking products. The SEC has to respond to Consensys\\' complaint by July 1.\\xa0 \\n\\n The SEC\\'s Wells notice means that the agency is still likely pursuing Consensys, said Marc Fagel, former regional director at the SEC, in an interview.\\xa0 \\n\\n \"At this point, there\\'s no basis to conclude they\\'re changing their stance on aggressive enforcement actions in the crypto space,\" Fagel said.\\xa0 \\n\\n The agency\\'s decision to close its investigation doesn\\'t set policy, Fagel said. However, the SEC is unlikely to bring cases involving Ethereum in the future, he added.  \\n\\n \"This pretty strongly suggests that the SEC is not going to keep pursuing any cases involving sales of ETH, whether it\\'s the issuer of the asset or exchanges that are facilitating trades,\" Fagel said.  \\n\\n As for whether the close of Ethereum 2.0 means anything for spot Ethereum ETFs, BakerHostetler\\'s Teresa Goody Guillén says it could lend support. \\n\\n \"The closing of the SEC’s investigation lends more support for the position that ether is a commodity,\" she said. \"Each ETF’s registration statements are still under review through a separate process and any delays would likely be unrelated to ether being treated as a security, particularly given that each ETF’s registration statement was amended to preclude staking of ether received or managed by the ETF.\" \\n\\n The SEC approved 19b-4 forms for eight spot Ethereum ETFs last month, but those products still need the agency greenlight for registration forms as part of a two-step process. Some ETF issuers received comments from the SEC last week on their S-1 forms with a deadline of Friday to turn them around, according to reporting from The Block.\\xa0 \\n\\n Danny Park contributed reporting.\\xa0 \\n\\n Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

The token, owned by San Francisco-based Ripple, has been under scrutiny as a civil securities lawsuit in Oakland moves forward. \\n\\n As reported by U.Today, yesterday, the district court judge allowed the lawsuit to move forward, ruling that it would be up to a jury to decide whether XRP qualifies as a security for retail buyers on exchanges. \\n\\n However, Alderoty emphasized that the California judge dismissed all allegations, suggesting that Ripple violated federal securities laws.

It’s now an industry that regulators want to control, celebrities endorse, and some of the biggest institutions are investing in.  \\n\\n This means that in just a decade, the story being told about the space to outsiders in an effort to lure them in as long-term users has also shifted. How do you tell a story about an ecosystem with very little history? How do you sell an idea that is constantly in a state of evolution? \\n\\n Cointelegraph spoke exclusively with Amanda Cassatt during Proof of Talk in Paris. Cassatt is the founder and CEO of Serotonin, a leading Web3 marketing company. She was formerly the chief marketing officer of Consensys and explains how she built one of the most successful marketing empires, telling the stories of Web3. Cointelegraph \\n\\n Storytelling where there is none \\n\\n Cassatt’s own journey into the crypto space began in 2015 as a founder in New York who was searching for a payment solution. It was then that she stumbled upon one of the early Ethereum meetups.\\xa0 \\n\\n “What I noticed, even though I wasn’t able to do due diligence on the codebase - was that this was a group of the smartest people that I had ever met and they were the most excited that I\\'d seen anyone of this number, this smart, probably in my whole life,” she explained.  \\n\\n Cassatt said it took them “a while” to explain the concepts behind Ethereum to her, as it wasn’t thoroughly or properly explained in “accessible ways” for non-technical people at the time. She added that the realization that Web3 could be an \"alternate foundation\" of a \"superior financial system\" blew her mind: \\n\\n This was the point at which she realized she had to join what she called the circus at the time. \\n\\n  “I realized that a lot of the folks in that crew didn\\'t really have storytelling backgrounds and weren\\'t familiar with how the media works,\" Cassatt explained. \\n\\n Eventually, growing into her role at Consensys, she became part of creating some of those explanations.\\xa0 \\n\\n Growth hacker roots \\n\\n However, telling the stories of a relatively nascent\\xa0space, especially in the 2015-2017 era, things were a lot different.  \\n\\n Cassatt explained that words like crypto, Bitcoin or Ethereum weren’t allowed on any paid platform such as Mailchimp, Google Ads, or Facebook — any of the Meta business suite platforms that are key to digital marketers. Cointelegraph \\n\\n She said that there was no way to do standard Web2 style programmatic advertising that catered towards the emerging sector: \\n\\n According to the Serotonin CEO, there are three kinds of marketing: owned, earned and paid. What they focused on in the early days of Consensys was owned and earned.\\xa0 \\n\\n Seeing more paid growth marketing in the space is a “reflection of the space maturing,” which Cassatt considers a positive development. \\n\\n Organizing the organizers \\n\\n One of the most effective tactics she recalled employing on behalf of Consensys was building a network of meetup organizers. She described this as people who wanted to add the “Ethereum meetup organizer” title for a certain city to their identity.\\xa0 \\n\\n \"We made sure they had the money for pizza and beer, or the culturally relevant equivalents,\" she said, \"or that they had standard decks and presentation templates to kind of standardize and professionalize how they were speaking about projects.” \\n\\n Cassatt said they eventually curated a roving content series of new DApps that would go on tour through all of the different meetups and pick up users and get feedback.  \\n\\n This meant there was always fresh and organic content, and that came with more efficiency of not having to organize every single meetup group ourselves.  \\n\\n “You make sure that you have a system that people want to opt into - an incentive framework with intrinsic and extrinsic motives. Plug people into that system, and empower them rather than having to come up with all the great ideas yourself as the marketer, then look around your community and see where there are sparks.” \\n\\n Every company is a media company \\n\\n Another visionary approach to the Web3 space, that can be applied to startups in a broader sense, is found in the way companies view the content they produce.\\xa0 \\n\\n Cassatt said startups should consider themselves as that and have, for example, an email newsletter where it covers all of the developments going on in a certain topic or space.Cointelegraph \\n\\n She pointed to her work at Consensys, where they launched various newsletters about “everything that was going on in Ethereum” so that people would read them for editorial value and not just production promotion.  \\n\\n Advice for the next generation \\n\\n And while one of the most challenging aspects of being in the Web3 space - whether one is a marketer, developer, or user- is keeping up with the rapid changes, Cassatt offered some evergreen advice: \\n\\n She said this also means that there isn\\'t a lot of start-up training or a lot of discipline and experience in the space compared to venture funded Web2 startups.  \\n\\n “I would learn how to actually find product market fit properly for a startup, come up with an idea, test it out on your people you know, that are in your target audience, see if they want to use it, see what they would pay for it,” she said.  \\n\\n Then, after the first frame of fit with those early evangelists is found, message it to the next concentric circle of people, see what they think, and see if they would use it: \\n\\n '}\n",

While activity is highly influenced by price, other changes are settled not by how prices gyrate but by time. \\n\\n Uniswap Users Are Increasingly Posting Small Trade Sizes \\n\\n Events in Uniswap, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum, draw the interest of Token Terminal, a blockchain analytics platform.  \\n\\n According to Token Terminal, a curious trend is happening in Uniswap: While the Ethereum ecosystem is expanding and expected to grow even more, trade sizes on Uniswap are shrinking rapidly. \\n\\n Over the last two years, the average trade size on the popular DEX has fallen from around $30,000 registered in 2022 to roughly $1,000 at press time. Commentators speculate that this trend could point to increasing adoption, especially among retailers.  \\n\\n Compared to institutions or crypto hedge funds that might want to trade huge chunks, most retailers lack those resources. They are more comfortable with lower trade sizes. \\n\\n This observation makes sense, especially with the explosion of meme coins deployed on the mainnet or layer-2 platforms like Base.  \\n\\n Though Uniswap first launched on the Ethereum mainnet, it is also available on Base, Arbitrum, and Polygon. It enables the trading of tokens in a low-fee environment.  \\n\\n On these platforms, market participants can trade on smaller sizes since they know the fee impact will be lower than on the mainnet.  \\n\\n Another perspective suggests that the rise of competing DEXs built on alternative blockchains like Solana and BNB Chain might be drawing activity away from Uniswap.  \\n\\n Modern blockchains like Solana offer faster transaction speeds and lower fees. With Ethereum processing 15 TPS at optimum, the higher scalability and interoperability with the first smart contracts platform can appeal to some traders. \\n\\n DEX Users Rapidly Climbing As Ethereum Finds Regulatory Clarity \\n\\n The decline in trade size comes surprisingly alongside a surge in overall DEX activity. Another Token Terminal report shows that monthly active traders across leading DEXs, including Uniswap, stand at 11.2 million.  \\n\\n It is roughly 3 million short of the all-time posted in December 2021. This observation suggests that though more traders post smaller sizes, more users are keen on exploring and participating.  \\n\\n Even as Uniswap’s average trade size falls, analysts are bullish on the protocol and UNI, its native token. The platform plans to launch Uniswap v4 while Ethereum now has regulatory clarity, especially with a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the way.  \\n\\n '}\n",

Their participation is strong despite the low prices, and their HODLing is impressive. Upon distributing the active addresses by profitability, it can be seen that the investors in profit make up less than 2% of all participating users. \\n\\n Generally, these investors in higher numbers are a threat to the asset as they tend to lean towards selling. Thus, ADA investors’ resilience of HODLing could benefit Cardano’s price going forward. \\n\\n In addition to HODLing, ADA holders could also switch to accumulation since the altcoin is ripe for picking according to the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. The MVRV ratio assesses investor profit and loss. \\n\\n Currently, Cardano’s 30-day MVRV stands at -11%, indicating losses, which may lead to buying pressure.\\xa0 \\n\\n Historically, ADA MVRV between -8% and -19% usually signals the start of rallies, marking an opportunity zone for accumulation.

The aforementioned cues suggest a bullish path for ADA is likely, enabling a rise to $0.42. \\n\\n However, for the same to happen, consistent bullishness is necessary.\\xa0 \\n\\n If ADA investors move to offset their losses by booking profits earlier than expected or before Cardano’s price breaches $0.42, it could halt the recovery.

The Coinbase Premium Gap, a measure that contrasts the price of Bitcoin on Coinbase Pro with those on other exchanges, is significantly negative, suggesting that Coinbase is currently executing orders of institutional investors who are willing to sell their holdings. \\n\\n The lengthy period of miner capitulation is also clarified by Willy Woo's analysis.

Over the weekend, all three of these assets will likely retain this outlook. \\n\\n BeInCrypto has analyzed where BTC, ETH, and XRP could land following this bearish week. \\n\\n Bitcoin’s Price Subdued \\n\\n Bitcoin’s price has been following a bearish double-top pattern for the past month. A double-top pattern is a bearish reversal formation characterized by two peaks at a similar level, indicating strong resistance. \\n\\n It suggests that the asset’s price is likely to decline after failing to break through the resistance twice. \\n\\n As BTC broke below the neckline, intense bearishness pursued. Consequently, the crypto asset fell from the neckline at $67,504 to the trading price of $63,6723. BTC is now closer to the target price of $63,068, as set by the bearish pattern, and could hit it over the weekend. \\n\\n At the same time, a bounce back in Bitcoin’s price is also expected. However, if it comes earlier, BTC could reclaim the support of $64,00 and $66,000. This would enable recovery and invalidate the bearish thesis. \\n\\n Ethereum’s Price Halts Recovery \\n\\n Ethereum’s price at $3,496 has been consolidated between $3,669 and $3,336. These levels form the 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci Retracement levels. ETH has been within this range for the last two weeks after the altcoin lost support at $3,700. \\n\\n It remains to be seen whether Ethereum’s price can break above or below the consolidation range. However, the chances of sideways movement continuing this weekend are very high. \\n\\n This bearish, neutral thesis would be invalidated if either of the range limits were disrupted, potentially sending ETH rallying to $3,800 or falling to $3,200 on the charts. \\n\\n XRP Price Sees No Rally Either \\n\\n The XRP price, hovering between $0.47 and $0.52, faces bearishness after failing the ascending triangle. Changing hands at $0.49, the altcoin could attempt to reclaim $0.51 as a support floor, which would also flip the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement into support. \\n\\n The sideways movement could continue since the broader market cues are not supporting a recovery right now. The aforementioned consolidation range could remain intact for a while. \\n\\n Nevertheless, the price could fall if XRP holders move to offset their losses by selling their holdings. This could result in a $0.46 or lower drawdown, invalidating the bullish–neutral thesis. \\n\\n '}\n",

It comes amid controversy over its\\xa0chosen claiming mechanism\\xa0for its ZRO token. The network introduced a new strategy for users to claim airdrop tokens. \\n\\n LayerZero employed this strategy to curb Sybil entities, which are manipulative, airdrop farming bots. The protocol required airdrop participants to deposit or donate $0.10 in USDC, USDT, or ETH to Protocol Guild, a collective of Ethereum developers, to claim each ZRO token. \\n\\n According to LayerZero, this token distribution model aligns with the protocol’s commitment to its long-term future. Further, the foundation committed to matching up to $10 million in donations to the Protocol Guild in support of Layer-1 (L1) developers on Ethereum. \\n\\n The condition did not sit well with crypto traders. While some likened it to a “tax,” others called it out for the “proof of donation” impression it gave and criticized the protocol. In their opinion, this was nothing close to an\\xa0airdrop. \\n\\n “Because the token is in exchange for a donation, it’s technically not an airdrop, and the team didn’t call it an airdrop anywhere in their comms… they explicitly say “This is not an airdrop”. Anyone could’ve bought the no side for like 5c just hours ago and be up 10x already,” X user DCF GOD\\xa0said.\\xa0 \\n\\n In hindsight, LayerZero had clarified that as it neared its token generation event, the term ‘airdrop’ was deliberately avoided because the event was not an airdrop. LayerZero Labs explained in a Thursday blog post that this distinction was intentional. \\n\\n The user also highlighted a drop in prediction platform Polymarket odds for the LayerZero airdrop, which crashed to 50% despite the token’s recent debut. \\n\\n LayerZero Daily Transactions Plummet \\n\\n Amidst the controversy, on-chain metrics suggest a bearish sentiment in the LayerZero ecosystem. Dune analytics data shows a drop of over 90% in daily transaction count. This repulsion away from its peak levels comes as airdrop farmers flee. \\n\\n A drop in daily transactions may suggest fewer users actively use the crypto project. This could reflect the overall market sentiment towards the crypto project. Investors or users have done this, moving away from protocols due to negative news, regulatory concerns, or lack of development progress. \\n\\n The negative sentiment has also extended to the protocol’s native token, ZRO, which has been down 22% in the past 24 hours. As of writing, the token is trading for $3.15, down from its $4.71 peak. \\n\\n '}\n",

When a scammer sends you some coins, this transaction gets added to your Ledger Live transaction history, and it will look like you already sent money to that wallet in the past. \\n\\n If you\\'ve ever seen a mysterious coin or NFT appear in your wallet - one that you didn\\'t send or ask anyone to send to you - then you may have been the target of an address-poisoning scam. \\n\\n Want to know how address poisoning scams work and how you can avoid them?

            "{'id': 'newsbtc:95ed1694e094b:0', 'title': 'Bitcoin Drops Below $64,000, But Arthur Hayes Advocates ‘Buy The Dip’', 'time': 'Fri, 21 Jun 2024 14:00:06 GMT', 'source': 'NewsBTC', 'description': 'Bitcoin is experiencing a significant decline today, dipping below the $64,000 mark to a low of $63,564. This drop represents a 2.5% decrease in the last 24 hours and an overall 12% decline over the past two weeks. Amidst this downward trend, Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, is not only maintaining his bullish stance on Bitcoin but actively encouraging investment, advocating a strategy to ‘buy the dip.’ His optimism and advice are deeply rooted in an analysis of global economic conditions and central bank policies, which he believes will favor cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. \\n\\n Buy The Bitcoin Dip? \\n\\n Hayes’s insights draw attention to the aggressive monetary policies implemented by central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve. These policies, including rapid interest rate hikes—the most aggressive since the 1980s—were initiated in response to rising inflation in the United States. The hikes have had a profound impact on the bond market, particularly affecting US Treasuries (USTs), which saw a decrease in prices due to the rising yields. Japanese banks, in search of yield amid domestically near-zero interest rates, had heavily invested in these USTs. \\n\\n The strategy backfired when US rates rose, leading to significant paper losses for these banks. Hayes specifically points to the situation with Norinchukin Bank, which was compelled to sell off $63 billion in foreign bonds, mostly USTs, to reduce these losses. This scenario underscores a broader trend among Japanese banks, which may need to continue offloading USTs and other foreign bonds as they adjust to the new economic realities imposed by US monetary policy. \\n\\n Hayes argues that these developments have critical implications for the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin. He notes that the responses by central banks to stabilize financial markets—such as the Federal Reserve’s decision to provide a blanket backstop in March 2023 following a series of bank failures—indirectly benefit cryptocurrencies. This intervention led to a surge in Bitcoin’s price, reinforcing its status as a viable alternative investment during times of financial instability. \\n\\n Moreover, Hayes points out the operational details of the FIMA repo facility, which was expanded by the Fed to bolster liquidity. He explains, “A rise in the FIMA repo facility indicates an addition of dollar liquidity to the global money markets. Y’all know what that means for Bitcoin and crypto … which is why I thought it necessary to alert readers about another avenue of stealth money printing.” This mechanism allows central banks to exchange their holdings of USTs for dollars, increasing the dollar supply without flooding the market with bonds and potentially driving up yields. \\n\\n The implications for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are profound, according to Hayes. He suggests that as central banks, particularly the Bank of Japan, might use these facilities to manage their exposure to USTs, the resultant increase in dollar liquidity could drive investors towards cryptocurrencies. This movement is seen as a hedge against potential inflation and currency debasement resulting from these monetary expansions. \\n\\n Hayes vividly describes the effect of these macroeconomic maneuvers on the crypto market: “Just as many began to wonder where the next jolt of dollar liquidity would come from, the Japanese banking system dropped Origami cranes composed of crisply folded dollar bills upon the laps of crypto investors. This is just another pillar of the crypto bull market. The supply of dollars must increase to maintain the current Pax Americana dollar-based filthy financial system.” \\n\\n In a rallying call to the crypto community, Hayes concludes, “Say it with me, ‘Shikata Ga Nai’, and buy the fucking dip!” Through this declaration, he underscores his belief that despite the volatile market conditions, the underlying economic and monetary developments are creating favorable conditions for Bitcoin’s growth. His analysis suggests that savvy investors should view the current price drops as buying opportunities, given the broader economic backdrop that he believes will continue to propel interest and investment in cryptocurrencies. \\n\\n At press time, BTC traded at $64,159. \\n\\n '}\n",

This is not a final determination.”  \\n\\n Consensys believes the SEC’s withdrawal from its investigation of Ethereum has removed a significant burden that threatened the network’s survival.Cointelegraph \\n\\n The “momentous” SEC retreat has settled the dust from negative regulatory concerns regarding ETH as a security, but how will ETH’s price react to having a clearer path? The SEC investigation also affected cryptocurrencies with similar attributes to Ether, so which altcoins could benefit from Ethereum’s liberation?\\xa0 \\n\\n Observers say Ether price is set to surge \\n\\n The Ether price has been relatively stable since the SEC stopped its investigation, following a horizontal pattern that has persisted since the news of spot Ether ETF approval on May 23.Cointelegraph \\n\\n At publishing time, Ether is down 2%. This has led some traders to wonder whether ETH will surge and if the altcoin market will follow.\\xa0 \\n\\n Other market observers say there is great potential for future growth. \\n\\n Conor O’Neill, community lead and partner of investment analytics company Blockcircle, told Cointelegraph that “the major regulatory barrier” for Ethereum has been removed and that it “sets a significant precedent for regulators worldwide.” \\n\\n The SEC shutting down the investigation “removes a considerable element of risk and uncertainty for any investors.” O’Neill believes the price of Ethereum is set to surge: \\n\\n There are also other elements to consider. \\n\\n The expected launch of spot Ether exchange-traded funds on July 2 will undoubtedly impact the price of ETH. As was the case when the U.S.-based spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs launched in January, traditional markets are expected to begin injecting capital into the ETFs, producing a higher demand for ETH and boosting its price.  \\n\\n O’Neill explained that the ETH ETF “is highly likely to have a long-term positive impact on the price of Ethereum.”  \\n\\n Recent: Crypto clicker games need real token use cases to be sustainable \\n\\n In the short term, “we might see a sell-the-news event similar to what we saw when the Bitcoin ETFs were approved.” He said that a short-term pullback should be expected, as some of this news will be priced in when the ETF trading commences. \\n\\n Although the ETH ETF approval is positive news for the crypto markets, Blockcircle’s partner highlighted that the SEC had approved Ether ETFs under certain conditions.  \\n\\n ETF issuers cannot offer an Ether ETF with staking. Goforth explained that this is because “the SEC has alleged that staking itself involves an investment contract,” removing the possibility of providing extra gains to its holders.  \\n\\n O’Neill believes that if the SEC maintains tight regulatory control over digital assets with total opposition to staking, it could harm ETH’s long-term performance as an institutional asset and, therefore, negatively affect its price. \\n\\n Some have also questioned whether Grayscale outflows, as with the Bitcoin ETF, could affect the Ether price after ETFs launch.Its Grayscale Ethereum Trust, with a valuation over $10 billion, could begin to see major outflows after ETH ETFs launch. This could affect ETH’s price as it did with Bitcoin.  \\n\\n O’Neill explained that Grayscale outflows significantly outpaced inflows to the new Bitcoin ETFs because of its higher management fees. \\n\\n However, he highlighted that the Grayscale fee for its Ether trust has been reduced to levels comparable to other Ether ETF providers. \\n\\n In his opinion, this indicates that Grayscale doesn’t want a repeat of the Bitcoin ETF launch and believes that the amount of ETH held by Grayscale “is likely to increase exponentially with the launch of the ETF.”Cointelegraph \\n\\n O’Neill predicted that ETH will “follow a similar trajectory to Bitcoin’s price, with a dip followed by an exponential rise.”\\xa0 \\n\\n However, he noted one central distinction between the Ether ETF and the Bitcoin ETF: the surprise effect of the sudden approval. \\n\\n The price of Ether has a clear path ahead as one of its major opposing fundamental arguments against it has been removed. If ETH surges, will the altcoins follow? \\n\\n Altcoin prices can benefit indirectly  \\n\\n When Bitcoin price surges, it creates a lift-up effect for the entire crypto market. Similarly, this occurs in the altcoin market when Ether surges.  \\n\\n So, which altcoins could benefit from following the latest news? \\n\\n The SEC halting its investigation may be relevant to other altcoins the agency has accused of being securities.  \\n\\n The SEC has opened cases against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase for a variety of securities law violations. The SEC has named several altcoins as securities, including Solana’s (SOL), Cardano’s (ADA) and Polygon’s (MATIC). \\n\\n O’Neill believes that projects such as Aave or Chainlink from the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector or layer-2 chains such as Arbitrum, Optimism or Base could benefit from the SEC’s retreat.\\xa0 \\n\\n Related:\\xa0SEC drops Ethereum investigation to avoid ‘embarrassing’ court case \\n\\n However, O’Neill remarked that many offer staking capabilities and are not yet entirely free from SEC scrutiny.  \\n\\n The SEC’s stance could change drastically as the U.S. presidential election approaches, with Donald Trump advocating for pro-crypto measures.  \\n\\n SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s future would be uncertain, as would the regulatory agency’s opposition to staking. Some even speculate that altcoin ETFs could hit the market.  \\n\\n The sudden approval of a spot Ether ETFs, the growing number of ETF issuers, and the withdrawal of the SEC’s investigation signal a potential shift in the SEC’s approach. These changes mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market. \\n\\n '}\n",

The event celebrates the founding date of Chinese giant JD.com which is the region’s second-largest in terms of annual sales, according to CNBC.
